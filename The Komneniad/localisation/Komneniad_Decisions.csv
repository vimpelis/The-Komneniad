RUS_crimean_war_title;The Crimean War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RUS_crimean_war_desc;Once again, the negotiations with the Byzantine Empire have broken down, and we are left with no choice but to seize Crimea by force. To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ADU_reclaim_frontier_title;Reclaim the Frontier;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ADU_reclaim_frontier_desc;During the Great Peninsular War of 1756-1777, the combined Espanian-Occitan armies have overwhelmed the forces of Al-Andalus and pushed us behind the Tagus river. Now, the time has come to cross the wretched river and liberate the Muslims under Spanish rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
trapezuntine_tea_title;Trapezuntine Tea;;;;;;;;;;;;;
trapezuntine_tea_desc;Despite the growing popularity of tea in $COUNTRY$, there are no tea producing provinces in our homeland. Now the microclimate region along the eastern coast of the Black Sea was identified by specialists as an ideal spot to start tea production, which will contribute to the task of fulfilling the growing demand for tea by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
diplomacy_failed;Diplomacy has failed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RUS_develop_klyuchevsk_title;Develop Klyuchevsk;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RUS_develop_klyuchevsk_desc;Klyuchevsk, meaning "key town" in Russian, was founded on the Baltic Coast in 1732 in place of the old fortress of Oreshek. It was intended to be the primary Russian port on the Baltic, however, the marshes around the river Neva turned out to be too costly to drain, so the construction was subsequently abandoned and the town remained relatively small. Now, however, we have the necessary technologies to finally bring the city to its intended glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
unite_the_yue_title;Unite the Yue;;;;;;;;;;;;;
unite_the_yue_desc;Our Northern neighbours are finally waking up from their slumber. This means that things cannot continue the way they are right now: the division between Nanyue and Minyue must end. We must unify the Yue and create a prosperous realm in the South!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
YUE_annex_taiwan_title;Integrate Taiwan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
YUE_annex_taiwan_desc;When the Ming dynasty fell, the island of Taiwan was seized by imperial loyalists, who established the Tungning kingdom with Koxinga in charge. We have since ignored the island, being content with a simple poorly-enforced blockade on these morons with delusional ideas of 'imperial restoration'. Things are much different now, and we must finally end the status quo and properly integrate the valuable island into our realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
YUE_annam_hegemony_title;Hegemony in Annam;;;;;;;;;;;;;
YUE_annam_hegemony_desc;The Kingdom of Nanyue of old held the entirety of modern Tonkin and Annam, enjoying the hegemony over the Gulf of Tonkin and the lucrative trade here. With the Dainamese people being quite culturally similar to us, we can finally finish what was started almost a century ago and incorporate the Nguyen kingdom into our realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
YUE_formalize_southern_borders_title;Formalize Southern Borders;;;;;;;;;;;;;
YUE_formalize_southern_borders_desc;Having secured the loyalty of the Dainamese, we may now turn our attention to securing the flanks of our newly-conquered lands. The opportunistic Lao tribes, despite being pushed back significantly, still hold the high ground over Tonkin, and the Dali kings rule over a large amount of Zhuang peoples, who would much rather stay with us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
YUE_northern_expedition_title;Northern Expedition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
YUE_northern_expedition_desc;Ever since the Han Empire conquered Nanyue and Minyue in the 2nd century BC, the South has been in a subservient position to the emperors of the North. We finally rid ourselves of this status when we broke off from the Shun in the 17th century, and now it is time for the Yue to show the Han that we are a force to be reckoned with. We shall organize a grand expedition to the North and seize the borderlands, where the local Hakka population will surely welcome us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
YUE_liberate_wu_title;Liberate the Wu;;;;;;;;;;;;;
YUE_liberate_wu_desc;Out of all of the Southern peoples, the Wu have had the weakest national identity of all. Located in lands firmly held by the Shun, who suppressed any notion of distinct national identity, the Wu are mostly content with the current flow of things. We, however, know better: securing at least the southern part of Anhui will bring a significant amount of loyal peoples under our rule and put the major Han city of Nanjing into a vulnerable position, making the Han think twice before attempting to reclaim these lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
YUE_reinforce_bo_ni_title;Reinforce Bo-Ni;;;;;;;;;;;;;
YUE_reinforce_bo_ni_desc;The island of Bo-Ni, known to the locals as Kalimantan and to the Westerners as Borneo, houses a significant amount of Chinese immigrants, who came here to work for the kongsi, which are mining organizations that exploit the local gold and tin depostits. They are the primary reason for why we currently hold lands on the island, and we see no reason not to expand their operations over the rest of the island, considering the activization of European activities in the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
YUE_proclaim_scs_hegemony_title;Proclaim the South China Sea Hegemony;;;;;;;;;;;;;
YUE_proclaim_scs_hegemony_desc;The South China Sea has been a traditional area of operations for the Min and the Yue, where we conducted our trade and held much influence. As such, it is logical that our primary objective should be establishing total control over the coastal areas of the sea, annexing large swathes of land that are currently held by the imperialist powers of the West. They surely won't be too happy about our ambitions, but who are they to stop the rising Yue thalassocracy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
YUE_accept_tawalisi_title;Accept the Tawalisi;;;;;;;;;;;;;
YUE_accept_tawalisi_desc;The people of the Tawalisi archipelago have historically maintained close ties with our merchants. Now that we are in control of the islands, we may integrate them into our society for good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
YUE_accept_minors_title;Accept the Minor Peoples;;;;;;;;;;;;;
YUE_accept_minors_desc;Our goal of hegemony in the South China Sea made us come into closer contact with several less significant peoples of Southeast Asia, such as the Cham. Having been oppressed by their overlords, most of them think of us as of another conqueror. We must prove them wrong and secure their loyalty, as they will be a useful asset in further strengthening of our country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
unify_china_title;Unify China;;;;;;;;;;;;;
unify_china_desc;China lies in a sorry state. Petty lords wage war for land, barbarians besiege the realm and the Imperial authority is non-existent. By crushing all opposition and enforcing our will all over China, we may finally put an end to the internal strife and unify the Middle Kingdom under our banner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHI_reclaim_south_title;Reclaim the South;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHI_reclaim_south_desc;During the collapse of the Ming Dynasty, the Southern coast of China was seized by the merchant states of Nanyue and Minyue, who since have established their own distinct national identities. This cannot continue, we must do what Shun failed to do two hundred years ago - bring them back into the fold!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHI_reclaim_yunnan_title;Reclaim Yunnan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHI_reclaim_yunnan_desc;The Kingdom of Dali is a relatively new polity, being established during the hasty retreat of the Shun. The largely Muslim kingdom must be annexed into China, no matter whether they think of themselves as a neutral country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHI_freedom_of_religion_title;Enact Freedom of Religion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHI_freedom_of_religion_desc;With each passing year we feel more pressure both from within and from the outside to get on with the times and accept the large amount of Muslims in our country. With the recent changes to our political landscape, we can finally recognize the Hui as equals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHI_integrate_the_south_title;Integrate the South;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHI_integrate_the_south_desc;The destruction of independent polities in the South means that we can finally begin the process of reintegration of the local population into the economic and political life of our country. The centuries of cultivated hatred towards the Han has certainly had its effect, and no matter what the process will be quite arduous and time-consuming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHI_reclaim_taiwan_title;Reclaim Taiwan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHI_reclaim_taiwan_desc;In the 17th century, a large amount of Ming loyalists together with their leader Koxinga have fled to the island of Taiwan, establishing their own kingdom with the goal of reclaiming the mainland. Times are surely different now, and no matter the political landscape on the island, the valuable island must be brought into the fold, for the first time ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHI_northern_frontier_title;The Northern Frontier;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHI_northern_frontier_desc;No Chinese Empire has exerted full control over the Gobi desert, which served as a natural protection against the nomads of Mongolia. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that the important cities of the North, such as Beijing, can only be sufficiently guarded if we control the desert and the Manchurian coast ourselves. Besides, the land is rich with natural resources, which we will make sure to use during our industrialization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHI_build_arsenal_title;The $OURCAPITAL$ Arsenal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CHI_build_arsenal_desc;With the proliferation of Western firearms, we are starting to feel the difficulties of actually buying them from the Europeans. Either raising the prices to an unreasonable value, or outright refusing to sell anything to us, the Europeans are unreliable. We must establish local production of modern weapons in our capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KOR_form_tultaehan_title;The Korean Candidate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KOR_form_tultaehan_desc;The peoples of China and Korea have historically been very close, their history and culture intertwined inseparably. A most ambitious plan proposed by King Munjo promises to elevate this connection to a highest level, and if our expedition into China succeeds, this may very well erase all divisions between the Han of China and the Han of Korea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KOR_eat_manchuria_title;Conquer Manchuria;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KOR_eat_manchuria_desc;The Conquest of Manchuria technically started in th 17th century, when the fall of the Ming prompted Korea to begin undertaking active measures to ensure its safety. However, we've never managed to properly subjugate most of the Wild Jurchens, as well as the Korchin Mongols and the Evenks residing North of the Amur river. Now it is time to right this wrong and finish what we started two centuries ago.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KOR_colonize_sakhalin_title;Annex Hwang'tae;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KOR_colonize_sakhalin_desc;The island of Hwang'tae, known to the Japanese as Karafuto and to the Russians as Sakhalin, lies right at the coast of our posessions in Manchuria. Controlling it would ensure safety of the Tatar Strait, though at the cost of angering the Russians and possibly dragging us into a future conflict with the Japanese.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KOR_end_to_chaos_title;An End to Chaos;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KOR_end_to_chaos_desc;One of the primary reasons of our current invasion is to secure peace and stability in East Asia, which has been plagued by chaos for nearly a century. The North might have been pacified, but the South remains unruly and chaotic. It is time to end the warlords once and for all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KOR_china_united_title;China United;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KOR_china_united_desc;The pacification of China has been successful. The warlords are no more, the foreign enroachers are crushed beneath our armies. It is time to properly integrate the Chinese bureaucracy and fix the consequences of decades of civil strife.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
IRY_middle_kingdoms_intervention_title;Middle Kingdoms Intervention;;;;;;;;;;;;;
IRY_middle_kingdoms_intervention_desc;After a long period of dormancy, things have finally kicked off in China. The small warlord statelets to the East are embroiled in bloody conflicts, trying to gain the upper hand in the process of Chinese Reunification. And it just so happens to be that the weakest of these states, Qin, sits right at our border. Perhaps, this opportunity might turn into something bigger... \n§RYou need to have 4 times more brigades than the owner of Shensi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
IRY_into_the_chaos_title;Into the Chaos;;;;;;;;;;;;;
IRY_into_the_chaos_desc;The Kingdom of Qin fell before our armies, their bureaucracy being integrated into ours. This means that we are ready to advance to the next step of our great plan: the crossing of the mountains to the South and the invasion of the fertile plains of Yangtze.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
IRY_the_open_plains_title;The Open Plains;;;;;;;;;;;;;
IRY_the_open_plains_desc;We have advanced deep into Chinese territory, now entering the so-called 'Central Plain'. This means that our cavalry can roam free all across the most important regions of China - we must exploit it to the fullest! \n§RUnlocks the Chinese Reunification CB.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
IRY_form_xie_title;Found the Xie Dynasty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
IRY_form_xie_desc;The Han have considered the peoples of the steppes to be their biggest enemy, even building the Great Wall to keep us out of China. Alas, this did not help them, as we are now at the brink of unifying China. It seems like in their pride they have forgotten the Buddhist principles many of them claim to follow, and so we shall bring the word of Dalai Lama to them and found an empire where there is no place for hate - the Xie Empire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
IRY_liberate_manchuria_title;Liberate Manchuria;;;;;;;;;;;;;
IRY_liberate_manchuria_desc;The Manchus are close relatives of the Mongols, but despite that, they never really acomplished anything of note besides the establishment of the short-lived Jin dynasty. Currently they are being colonized by the Koreans and the Russians, and, as a brotherly steppe-dwelling nation, we shall liberate them and add them into the fray.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HUI_southern_reclamation_title;Begin the Southern Reclamation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HUI_southern_reclamation_desc;With the Northern Capital in our hands, we may finally look to the South and crush the disorganized warlords that hold our rightful land. \n§RUnlocks the Chinese Reunification CB.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PHI_reclaim_ayutthaya_title;Reclaim Ayutthaya;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PHI_reclaim_ayutthaya_desc;Once we gather enough strength, we may finally challenge the Burmese occupiers and reclaim the ancestal lands of the Thai, pressing our claim to estore a unified Siam, unseen since 1767.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BUR_integrate_assam_title;Integrate Assam;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BUR_integrate_assam_desc;Our unexpected victories in Assam have brought the local population, who hail us as liberators, to recognize our rule as legitimate in all of Assam. Let us embrace the Assamese, for they might prove to be a valuable asset against any Western threat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BUR_end_the_stagnation_title;End the Stagnation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BUR_end_the_stagnation_desc;The Konbaung Empire has been stagnant ever since the Sack of Ayutthaya in 1767, except for a few minor unseccessful engagements into Yunnan. This is a dangerous state of affairs, as we continue to rule over a large number of hostile peoples, whose desires for freedom are ever-increasing. We must rectify this and reform our kingdom to be a true regional hegemon, for if we do not do it now, the rising polities in the East that we failed to conquer may blow us a most humiliating blow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIA_invade_malaya_title;Invade Malaya;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIA_invade_malaya_desc;The Malay Peninsula houses many small Muslim polities. They are disunited and weak, and yet their lands are rich and could provide control over the straits to the South. We must crush the, before the Europeans get to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIA_partition_cambodia_title;Partition Cambodia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIA_partition_cambodia_desc;Several close advisors in our court have proposed offering a lucrative deal to our friends in France: partitioning the massive Cambodia between our countries. We could try to defeat them on our own, yes, bu we better now risk it and just take the opportunity we have, lest we might have a problem with the French interests in Cochinchina.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIA_annex_cambodia_title;Annex Cambodia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIA_annex_cambodia_desc;Cambodia not only benefitted from the collapse of Ayutthaya, they also prevented the later unification and seized Thai-populated lands. Surely this is not the end of their ambitions, and we shall not allow them to become even mightier, like back in the days of the Khmer Empire. We need to crush them, even at a cost of potentially coming into conflicts with European interests in Cochinchina.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIA_annex_cambodia_2_title;Annex Cambodia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIA_annex_cambodia_2_desc;The lands of Cambodia are populated by a nation closely related to our people - the Khmer. Their state no longer exists, and we must seize this opportunity and take the highly important heartland of the old Khmer Empire, lest it gets seized by Western imperialist powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIA_annex_laos_title;Annex Laos;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIA_annex_laos_desc;Our dominance in Laos is undisputed at this point. Let us properly finish the Lao and crush all resistance that might be left there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIA_integrate_laos_title;Integrate Laos;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIA_integrate_laos_desc;With Laos annexed, we can start the process of integration of these unruly lands. Though it may be hard, it would be a major victory for the Thai state, for our old enemies are now our subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIA_integrate_cambodia_title;Integrate Cambodia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIA_integrate_cambodia_desc;Cambodia has been conquered by our triumphant armies. Let us integrate the local Khmer infrastructure and bureaucracy with our own, securing a highly-populated area for our growing kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
franco_siamese_border_treaty_title;Franco-Siamese Border Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
franco_siamese_border_treaty_desc;French Indoshina has grown beyond the wildest predictions of our colonial governors. We have successfully secured Dainam, and yet a certain issue bother us - the neighboring Siamese state, which controls many Lao lands and exerts substantial influence over Cambodia. We may just be able to persuade them into giving up their holdings in Laos, or, otherwise, take them by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
IDC_form_title;Unite Indochina;;;;;;;;;;;;;
IDC_form_desc;The Indochinese Peninsula, as it is called by the Europeans, was never close to unification, as it is populated by diverse peoples, who more often than not held resentment for each other. The times are different, however, and the continued survival of our nation reqires a creation of a unified Indochinese identity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MLY_form_title;Unite the Malay States;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MLY_form_desc;The small polities on the Malay Peninsula have never had a unified state of their own, instead each having its own prince. The time has come to end this state of affairs and unify the Malay states once and for all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BAV_reassert_dominance_title;Reassert German Dominance;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BAV_reassert_dominance_desc;No doubt inspired by the revolution in Sweden, the Franconian Crisis was a dangerous precedent that cannot be allowed to happen again. It has shown that our current political course cannot guarantee safety for Germany and the German people, which means it is time to take a more active stance in our goal of German unification. \n§RUnlocks the German Unification CB;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF_form_title;Form the South German Federation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SGF_form_desc;The lands of Upper Germany have historically been closely intertwined with each other. The creation of the German Confederation moved the Kingdom of Bavaria and the constituents of the former Swabian Circle even closer together, and in our quest of German Unification, the creation of a unified Federation in the South would serve as an important step towards German Unity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GER_form_title;Three Hurrahs for Germany!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GER_form_desc;The idea of a unified Germany has been ever-present in the minds of the German people ever since the German Renaissance of the 1780s. The nation's efforts were directed entirely towards achieving that goal for more than 50 years, and despite many setbacks and defeats we've had to face, the German Dream still burns bright in our hearts. And no matter what, it shall triumph: The German Confederation shall finally cease to exist, instead giving way to a new power in Central Europe - the German Empire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GER_retake_prussia_title;Retake Prussia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GER_retake_prussia_desc;Prussia was unjustly stolen from us by the Zapadoslavs in the late 1830s, when Germany was shaken by the Franconian Crisis. They may tear Prussia away from the German Confederation, but they can't destroy the idea of a United Germany. The people of Prussia yearn for liberation, and let us deliver it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GER_unite_the_swiss_title;Unite the Swiss;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GER_unite_the_swiss_desc;The Swiss population is currently divided between the Switzerland proper, a member of the Confederation, and the so-called 'Bern Confederation', a union of Western Swiss cities protected by the Arelat. It is no secret this political entity is entirely temporary, and now it is time to integrate the Confederation into the Greater German State.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GER_retake_schlesien_title;Retake Schlesien;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GER_retake_schlesien_desc;Silesia was once a part of the Holy Roman Empire, dominated by the Kingdom of Bohemia and being a place where the Slavic and the Germanic worlds met, the different peoples intermingling with each other. It ended with the secession of Bohemia from the Empire in 1716, and as they took Silesia with them, all German influence disappeared from the area. With the Unification of Germany we can turn our attention to the last remainders of Germans who are a sizeable minority in the area and press pur claim, however tenuous it might be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GER_the_western_reaches_title;The Western Reaches;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GER_the_western_reaches_desc;As we finish the process of collecting all German lands under one state, we turn our attention to the weakest of our claims, those on the Western border. Here lie sizeable minorities and even majorities of Germans, most of them living in the part of Duchy of Luxemburg that was not included in the German Confederation, as well in the city of Metz and its surroundings. Taking these lands would be a boon to our prestige, and, most importantly, it will strengthen our position in any future conflicts in the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GER_autonomy_venice_title;Venetian Autonomy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GER_autonomy_venice_desc;The rapidly changing situation in Italy threatens our posessions in Veneto, awarded to us during the Constantinople Accords. The local population, despite the relative distance of the old Venetian Republic from overall Italian politics, still considers itself Italian, and as such, they are becoming increasingly more hostile to us. Perhaps, if we were to create an autonomous Kingdom in these lands, we would be able to keep the tides of Italian nationalism at bay for the time being.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NGF_form_title;Form the North German Federation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NGF_form_desc;Lower German states have not not played a significant role in German politics of the last centuries. Disunity accompanied us all the way since the conquest of these lands from the Slavic tribes, and we have utilized it how we could, the prime example being the Hanseatic League. The times are different now, and it is evident that we can no longer afford to be disunited. A Federation of all North German states will be the first step towards our idea of a unitary, centralised Germany.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SAF_open_the_frontiers_title;Open the Frontiers;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SAF_open_the_frontiers_desc;South Africa is a land of opportunity. The virgin prairies of Kaapland await those who are tired from war and poverty of Europe and want to start a new life. Lets us open the frontiers and welcome our brothers from across the pond!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SAF_claim_the_karoo_title;Claim the Karoo;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SAF_claim_the_karoo_desc;The Great Karoo desert houses many Trekboer nomads. While these lands are infertile, controlling would serve as great protection against any possible incursions from the north, however unlikely they will be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SAF_northern_frontier_title;The Northern Frontier;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SAF_northern_frontier_desc;With the activization of European colonial activities in Africa comes the need to secure the lands we claimed in the North. We will establish outposts all over the lands we now call Namaqualand, thus firmly securing them for future settlement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SAF_along_the_coast_title;Along the Coast;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SAF_along_the_coast_desc;The coast to our east houses a large population of Xhosa and Nguni peoples, with the latter being organized into the strongest state in the area, the Zulu Kingdom. This region has colloquially been known by the Europeans as Kaffraria, or, when referring to the Zulu part, Natalia. Securing the coast would mean securing the inner regions from European incursion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SAF_oranje_vaal_title;Oranje-Vaal Campaign;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SAF_oranje_vaal_desc;With the coast secured, we may finally move into the lands known as Transvaal and Transorangia. There, several Boer republics have been established, though they are not big enough to play any role outside of the region. Lets us move into these lands and integrate our brethen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SAF_push_to_zambezi_title;The Push to Zambezi;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SAF_push_to_zambezi_desc;Our expansion must not stop with the Bushveld. Several poorly-organized tribes exist in the north, on the banks of the great Zambezi River, and if we were to move quickly, we could potentially extend our border all the way to the River itself, thus solidifying our position as the hegemon of South Africa, and possibly even of the entire continent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA_unification_call_title;Call for Unification;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA_unification_call_desc;With the fall of the Sultanate of Oman, we are the only major power left on the peninsula. It is time to move north and liberate Mashriq from all sorts of unbelievers!;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA_proclaim_caliphate_title;Proclaim the Wahhabi Caliphate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARA_proclaim_caliphate_desc;The Wahhabi movement has reached incredible heights. Our conquests are spoken of in all corners of the world, for a few decades ago our name was not known to those outside of the region. And out of a small desert statelet we have carved out a great empire - thus let us proclaim the Caliphate of the Unitarians and bring forth a new Golden Age of Islam!;;;;;;;;;;;;
ADU_absorb_catalonia_title;Absorb Catalonia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ADU_absorb_catalonia_desc;Across the Ebro River live the Catalan people. The have managed to stay independent for centuries due to being subjects under the mighty Occitan Kingdom, one of our greatest rivals. With the reconquest of the Frontier we may march into Barcelona once again, for the Occitans are no more and the united France has shown no interest in protecting their former subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SPA_reconquista_east_title;Reconquest of the East;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SPA_reconquista_east_desc;The Long Peace of Iberia is coming to an end. The Moors are gearing up for the reclamation of their former lands, and the Catalan Republic is becoming increasingly unstable. Such circumstances force us to act, lest we will lose the initiative to our enemies. And the obvious direction of our actions would be to the East, where the people of the Ebro River toil under the Moorish thumb. We shall be welcomed as liberators - and it will only be the first step.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SPA_kill_catalonia_title;The Issue of Catalonia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SPA_kill_catalonia_desc;Our swift push to the Mediterranean Sea has not gone unnoticed by the various political forces of the Catalan Republic. Many are saying that considering their diplomatic isolation, they will not be able to keep their independence. We must decide on our course of action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SPA_annex_catalan_puppet_title;Annex the Duchy of Barcelona;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SPA_annex_catalan_puppet_desc;Time is out for the Dukes of Barcelona. They have enjoyed autonomy for several decades, but the circumstances are different now. For the continued prosperity of the realm, we must incorporate the lands of Catalonia directly into the Espanian state, ending their autonomy once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SPA_press_gothic_claim_title;Press the Gothic Claim;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SPA_press_gothic_claim_desc;Our decision to allow for a return of the Barcelona Dynasty offers us a unique opportunity. At different times, the Dukes of Barcelona were allowed to administer the March of Gothia, giving them a strong enough claim to the region. Pressing their claim would ruin our relations with the French, but it will grant us control over an important section of the Mediterranean coastline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SPA_reconquista_center_title;Reconquest of the Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SPA_reconquista_center_desc;The Moorish hold on Iberia is weaker than ever following our liberation of the Ebro Valley and the Mediterranean coast. The balance of power in Iberia lies shattered, with the initiative in our hands. The centuries-long struggle to liberate the peoples of Iberia is finally coming to a close, for the inner Moorish lands are now our next target.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SPA_finish_reconquista_title;Finish the Reconquista;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SPA_finish_reconquista_desc;After more than a millenium, the Reconquista is coming to an end. The last strongholds of the Moors lie on the southern coast, known since Roman times as Baetica. Cordoba, Sevilla, Granada - all of these cities have been fully Arabized since times immemorial. We will finally take these lands and integrate them into Espania, for the betterment of all the peoples of Iberia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SPA_mauretanian_crusade_title;Mauretanian Crusade;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SPA_mauretanian_crusade_desc;The lands of North Africa have once been Christian, but in the centuries following the rise of Islam almost all communities of the faithful have been wiped out. We have pushed the Moors to the Rock of Gibraltar, but the Reconquista is not quite over yet: we will chase them across the sea and eliminate any possibility of them threatening Iberia in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MOR_restore_andalusia_title;Restore Al-Andalus;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MOR_restore_andalusia_desc;The Faithful have been pushed out of the Iberian Peninsula by the vile heathens of the north. If we manage to retake the heartlands of the Al-Andalus of old, we may proclaim the restoration of Muslim rule in Iberia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SPA_reverse_arabization_title;Reverse Arabization;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SPA_reverse_arabization_desc;Centuries of Moorish rule in Iberia have had quite an impact on the ethnoreligious landscape of the lands. One of the most horrible things that the Moors have acomplished was an erasure of national identity and language, both of which have been adapted to fit into the greater Andalusi identity. With the consolidation of our rule in the South we can reverse this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SPA_great_language_reform_title;The Great Language Reform;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SPA_great_language_reform_desc;Espania, and Iberia in general, is a land of great linguistical diversity. Many dialects and languages have developed independently of each other, and while it is fascinating for scholars, it is a nightmare for the bureaucrats. The strain that is put on our government apparatus by this is truly great, and by researching ways we can re-educate the people to speak a uniform language we can end this for good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
OMA_centralise_empire_title;Centralize the Omani Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
OMA_centralise_empire_desc;The Omani Empire is heavily decentralized, with the lands of Yemen and Qatar in particular enjoying great autonomy. By adopting Western methods of governance we will be able to centralize the state around a uniform center in Muscat, which will stregthen the Empire against any potential threats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ADU_restore_northern_rule_title;Restore Northern Rule;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ADU_restore_northern_rule_desc;The Kingdoms of North Iberia have enjoyed independence ever since our forces were thrown out of Gaul in 997. This region is known since Roman times to be difficult to control, and indeed, the constant rebellions by the local populace rendered our hold in it practically non-existant even before the disaster in Gaul. This time, we will integrate the region properly, ending any notion of resistance against our rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ADU_enact_conversion_decree_title;Enact the Conversion Decree;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ADU_enact_conversion_decree_desc;A necessary step in securing our dominion would be to gain the loyalty of the population. The problem is that the Christian faith will always drive the people against us, no matter our policies towards them. Clearly, the Jizya system that guaranteed autonomy for the local Christians has outlived its usefullness, as the populace has adapted to it and no longer feels the need to convert. We will task the best scholars of Al-Andalus to design education programs that would spread the Arabic script as well as the Islamic faith among our subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ADU_western_sahara_title;Down the African Coast;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ADU_western_sahara_desc;The Atlantic coast south of Morocco is a desolate desert, with no valuable resources and without any significant population. Its uselessness makes it particularly unattractive to other colonial powers. However, if someone was to take it, it would cut us off from the Sahel and Western Africa as a whole, so it's best that we lay claim to the region ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRB_form_flanders_title;Form Flanders;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRB_form_flanders_desc;Flanders was a country in the Holy Roman Empire that gave the name to a greater region, which includes our capital. The word itself means 'flooded area', and in our search for a national identity, it fits best to become a basis for our new state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRB_reorganise_holland_title;Reorganise Holland;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRB_reorganise_holland_desc;The Duchy of Holland has long been an autonomous polity within our kingdom, ruled by the local nobility. The national awakening of the last few decades has shown us that feudalism, no matter how stable it might seem to be, is, in fact, a ticking time bomb. The best course of action would be to incorporate the Duchy directly.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
BRB_take_friesland_title;Annex Friesland;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRB_take_friesland_desc;Being the only major Republic in the whole of the former Holy Roman Empire, Friesland is a major troublemaker in the region. Their alliance with the Westphalians and colonial ventures in India show that they are up to no good. Besides, they are culturally similar to us - is there no better pretext for annexation?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRB_unify_low_franconia_title;Unify Low Franconia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRB_unify_low_franconia_desc;With the unification of the Low Countries, we have only one pressing matter left at hand - the Rhenish Germans. They still consider themselves different from us, refusing to fully integrate. It is an opportunity, however: since changing their mind and forcefully making them accept our customs is going to be incredibly expensive, we could instead recognize them as a different, albeit brotherly, nation - one that would be a constituent of a Low Franconian Union. Undoubtedly ambitious, this plan shall become the basis of the Flemish foreign policy, that may lead to something even greater.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRB_save_england_title;Fate of the Martlet;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRB_save_england_desc;Our cousins across the Channel, the English, have been suffering under the Danish yoke for half a millenium. When they finally decided to throw it off in 1797, their overzealousness caused an all-European emergency, the Martletist Wars, out of which we gained the duchies of Kent and Sussex. Now, the English are awakening once again. We understand their desires for freedom and we will support them, but perhaps they are a bit too... hotheaded. A more sensible, level-headed approach is needed. They will get their freedom, but as our subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRB_form_westland_title;West Germanic Union;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BRB_form_westland_desc;The Lowlands, England and Lower Saxony share many similarities, stemming from the same roots. Our search for security and stability in the region led us to gaining large swathes of land and the sympathy of the local peoples, who we may consider brotherly. Perhaps, its is Flanders' geopolitical destiny to end the separation between West Germanic peoples in the form of a new union - Westland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
break_caerlleon_title;Break the Peace of Caerlleon;;;;;;;;;;;;;
break_caerlleon_desc;The recent events on the Isles clearly signify that the Treaty of Caerlleon has outlived its usefulness. Changes in the political landscape require greater freedom of actions, and no matter the economic consequences, we shall renounce the Treaty and openly position ourselves against our former partner.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CLT_invade_midlands_title;Invade the Midlands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLT_invade_midlands_desc;With the Peace of Caerlleon broken, we can no longer be sure of our safety on the Isles. Our continuous prosperity requires immediate action: we shall invade the rich lands of York and Mercia, thus depriving our Southern neighbour of much of their powerbase.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLT_unify_britain_title;Unify Prydain;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLT_unify_britain_desc;We find ourselves at the brink of complete dominion over the entire isle of Prydain. Before us lay the heartlands of the Anglo-Saxons - Wessex and Lundenburg. It is time to finally bring an end to centuries of Germanic rule in the Isles and unify them under the true natives of these lands - the Celts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLT_peace_on_the_isles_title;Peace on the Isles;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLT_peace_on_the_isles_desc;The Celtic Union is triumphant. We have completely dominated the Isles, kicking out the Danes, the Anglo-Saxons and even the opportunistic Flemish kings. We do not, however, possess the means to alter the ethnic landscape of our newly-acquired land. In order to maintain a good public image, as well as to finally integrate the lands into the Union fully, we will have to come to terms with the inhabitants of these lands. Only then will the Isles truly know peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DAN_ask_for_NZ_title;Ask for New Sjaelland;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DAN_ask_for_NZ_desc;Our Danish allies have recently established a colony on the islands of New Sjaelland in the Pacific Ocean. Currently, this colony is more trouble than it's worth, as there are no immediate natural resources on the isles and the natives are hostile to all. As such, we believe that the Danes may be willing to part with these isles freely, instead giving them to us, who desperately need a colony to work with.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
DAN_southeastern_cession_title;End the Southeastern Cession;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DAN_southeastern_cession_desc;The Southeastern Cession is the name of the part of England that was given to the King of Brabant in the aftermath of the Martletist Wars. We are unsure as to what the folks in Brussels have in mind regarding this land, and, besides, it was under rightful Danelander sovereignty since 1495 as the autonomous Duchies of Kent and Sussex. Currently, the Cession is the most immediate threat to stability on the isles, and it must be dealt with quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DAN_integrate_london_title;Integrate the Free City;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DAN_integrate_london_desc;The Free City of Lundenburg was created in the aftermath of the Martletist Wars as both a compromise between the Danelanders and the Brabantians and an independent state of the Anglo-Saxons. As time passes, we can finally evaluate the results of this experiment - and they are not quite what we would have wanted. Lack of any sort of concrete legislation against Martletist thought turned the Free City into a hotbed of English separatism and otherwise negative dealings. Before this problem spirals out of control once again, we must end the Free City's independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DAN_claim_britain_title;Claim Britain;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DAN_claim_britain_desc;The Peace of Caerlleon ended as unexpectedly as it began. The Celts and us now look at each other with severe distrust, realising that war is an inevitability. Our move would be to lay claim on the traditionally English lands in the north as well as Wales, all of which hold valuable resources for our industry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DAN_unify_britain_title;Unify Britain;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DAN_unify_britain_desc;In the Medieval times, Alba was heavily influenced by our Norse ancestors. Maybe not as much as Ireland, but we must nevertheless look to this example and prepare for a strike north, in an effort to disunite the Celts and end thir so-called 'Union'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DAN_integrate_celts_title;Integrate the Celts;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DAN_integrate_celts_desc;After our successful unification of Great Britain, we find ourselves ruling over masses of Celtic peoples. Unfortuantely, we will have to accept that the Danelanders would remain a minority, and give equal rights to our new subjects. Cymru and Alba will now be integral parts of our Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_minigame_switch_off_title;Turn off influence notifications;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_minigame_switch_off_desc;This decision allows you to turn off the influence change events. Be wary, however, that the minigame will decide your future expansion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_minigame_switch_on_title;Turn on influence notifications;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_minigame_switch_on_desc;This decision allows you to turn on the influence change events.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_conquer_naples_title;End the Neapolitan Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_conquer_naples_desc;The little Republic of Naples was left as an independent state following the Constantinople Accords, in an attempt by us to not become an international pariah by annexing too much land and by Arles to deprive us of access to the Ligurian Sea. With time, however, the Republic started leaning more and more towards Martletism, and it would be best for our holdings in Italy to not have a hotbed of Martletist activity right next to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_conquer_naples_a_title;Conquer Naples;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_conquer_naples_a_desc;The little Republic of Naples was left as an independent state following the Constantinople Accords, in an attempt by us to not become an international pariah by annexing too much land and by Arles to deprive us of access to the Ligurian Sea. With time, however, the Republic started leaning more and more towards Martletism, and it eventually succumbed to a foreign invasion. We need to secure this valuable city for ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_consolidate_longobardia_title;Consolidate Longobardia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_consolidate_longobardia_desc;Longobardia was reconquered in the 16th century by the Imperial forces, becoming an integral part of the Empire and serving as a staging point for invasions further north. Following the War of the Verona Alliance we lost these lands to the Hautevilles, but were able to regain them after Napoleone pushed the Hautevilles to Sicily. We did not, however, keep the whole region, as the Catholic powers of Europe all united in a diplomatic offensive to enlarge the Papal State. Now, with Naples in our hands, we will regain control over all of Longobardia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_conquer_sicily_title;Reclaim Sicily;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_conquer_sicily_desc;Sicily too was an integral part of the Empire, even housing a significant population of descendants of Greek settlers who still consider themselves Greek. Currently the island is held by the troublesome Hautevilles, who even managed to maintain a small colonial Empire. They have been a thorn in our side for centuries now, and the time has come to crush them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_rescind_bulgarian_assimilation_title;Rescind Bulgarian assimilation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_rescind_bulgarian_assimilation_desc;The policy of assimilating Bulgaria has been in place since the end of the Second Bulgarian Empire, and it has been somewhat successful in destroying Bulagrian identity in the theme of Thrace. However, it cannot continue like that - the state is wasting valuable resources by antogonizing Bulgarians instead of trying to integrate them. We will end this destructive practice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_punish_carpathia_title;Punish Carpathia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_punish_carpathia_desc;Carpathia is an unholy union that threatens the security of our Balkan holdings. We need to teach them a lesson on upsetting the balance of the region without our consent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_influence_romania_title;Influence Rumania;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_influence_romania_desc;Rumania has been under Imperial influence for centuries, or, arguably, for millenia, as the Rumanians are themselves descendants of Romans who settled in Dacia. They follow the Orthodox faith and have historically been tied to us politically, usually paying tribute or providing men for our armies. An excellent candidate to be integrated into the Empire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_vassalize_wallachia_title;Vassalize Wallachia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_vassalize_wallachia_desc;Wallachia is one of the three Rumanian principalities that have existed without change for centuries. If we court them and remind them of past connections, they will come under our vassalage willingly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_vassalize_moldavia_title;Vassalize Moldavia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_vassalize_moldavia_desc;Moldavia is one of the three Rumanian principalities that have existed without change for centuries. If we court them and remind them of past connections, they will come under our vassalage willingly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_vassalize_transylvania_title;Vassalize Transylvania;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_vassalize_transylvania_desc;Transylvania is one of the three Rumanian principalities that have existed without change for centuries. If we court them and remind them of past connections, they will come under our vassalage willingly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_conquer_romania_title;Conquer Rumania;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_conquer_romania_desc;Rumania has been under Imperial influence for centuries, or, arguably, for millenia, as the Rumanians are themselves descendants of Romans who settled in Dacia. They follow the Orthodox faith and have historically been tied to us politically, usually paying tribute or providing men for our armies. An excellent candidate to be integrated into the Empire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_integrate_romania_title;Integrate Rumania;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_integrate_romania_desc;With Rumania absorbed into the Empire, we can integrate the local populace into the Imperial administration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_kill_hungary_title;Conquer Hungary;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_kill_hungary_desc;Hungary, or Pannonia as it was known before, is a land stuck between many rocks and many hard places, itself at times managing to fulfill both roles. They were the Empire's foremost rival in the centuries past, controlling large swathes of the Balkans and protected by an alliance with the Occitans. But history was not kind to them, as they succumbed to a partition by their neighbours in the 18th century, and they were punished even further after trying to rectify their defeats during the Martletist Wars. An utterly defeated nation, Hungary must be conquered, as the influence the neighboring Slavs had on them will make their integration easier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_accept_hungarians_title;Accept the Hungarians;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_accept_hungarians_desc;With Hungary absorbed into the Empire, we can integrate the local populace into the Imperial administration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_reform_the_catepanates_title;Reform the Catepanates;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_reform_the_catepanates_desc;The Catepanates are an autonomous entity in name only, as they provide very little benefits to the South Slavic peoples who live in them. As tensions continue to grow, we face the threat of a massive uprising in the region. Instead of waiting for it to happen, we must implement Hellenophile ideas of Slavic integration and reform the Catepanates before it's too late.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_accept_slovenes_title;Accept the Slovenes;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_accept_slovenes_desc;With Slovenia absorbed into the Empire, we can integrate the local populace into the Imperial administration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_march_on_rome_title;March on Rome;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_march_on_rome_desc;Rome. The Eternal City, an ancient capital of the Roman Empire, the seat of the Pope... Whatever it is, the entire world knows that Rome is the most prized posession a state could have, after Constantinople of course. The reclamation of this ancient city was the focal point of Imperial foreign policy for more than a millenium. And even though our last attempt at securing the city ended with the disastrous War of the Verona Alliance, the recent instability in Italy does present a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_accept_south_italians_title;Accept South Italians;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_accept_south_italians_desc;All of Southern Italy is now under our control. We can integrate the local populace into the Imperial administration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_finish_belisarius_work_title;Finish Belisarius' work;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_finish_belisarius_work_desc;Rome is the center of Italy, the most important city to hold and the chokepoint that prevented us from going north. No Verona Alliance shall stop us now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_roman_italy_title;A Roman Italy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_roman_italy_desc;With Italy fully reconquered, we can integrate the local populace into the Imperial administration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_avenge_fourth_crusade_title;Avenge the Fourth Crusade;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_avenge_fourth_crusade_desc;The Fourth Crusade was the epitome of Latin treachery and overconfidence. Instead of attacking the vile heathens to the south, they turned their arms towards their supposed brothers in faith, setting sight towards Constantinople. They failed in the end, after Alexios II had thrown them into the sea. But we have not forgotten who were the perpetrators of this event. The perfidious city of Venice will be in Roman hands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_norican_frontier_title;Norican Frontier;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_norican_frontier_desc;While we would like to avoid conflicts with the Germans, the former Roman province of Norica is an integral part of their nation now, and we can't guarantee the safety of our Balkan and Italian holdings without establishing a defensive line in the mountains. We will have to seize the borderlands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRP_call_for_unification_title;Carpathian Call for Unification;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRP_call_for_unification_desc;The nations of Carpathia have been considered to be enemies for centuries. The Rumanians and Hungarians are disunited not just in language and religion, but also in mutual hatred. There is one thing that unites us however, the political and geographical positions which our people find themselves in. If we are to survive against bigger powers, we need to think pragmatically and try to overcome our differences by doing the impossible - proposing the unification of the two countries! \n§RThis decision requires you to have 10 prestige and either ally all 3 of Moldavia, Wallachia and Transylvania, defeat them in a war, or get up to 150 relations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
form_romania_title;Form Rumania;;;;;;;;;;;;;
form_romania_desc;The Rumanian people are very different form the neghboring Slavs, Hungarians and Greeks, being the heirs of the ancient Romans. We should unite the principalities to strengthen ourselves against any external threats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLT_ildathach_autonomy_title;Autonomy for Ildathach;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLT_ildathach_autonomy_desc;Our Colombian holdings have been developing a national identity for quite some time now. Perhaps it would be wise to grant them self-rule in order to prevent a revolt and make the governance of these land more effecient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ILD_take_inner_labrador_title;Take Inner Labrador;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ILD_take_inner_labrador_desc;The lands deep inside the Labrador peninsula are still unclaimed. Let us rectify that before anyone else does it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ILD_take_northern_lakes_title;Take the Northern Lakes;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ILD_take_northern_lakes_desc;While we control the coast of the Tomhrair Bay, the inner territories are not yet tamed. We must press our claims before any of our neigbours take advantage of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ILD_beyond_the_arctic_circle_title;Beyond the Arctic Circle;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ILD_beyond_the_arctic_circle_desc;Our recent colonisation efforts in the north yilded us large swathes of quite useless territory. In this situation the only logical choice would be to claim even more useless territory that has nothing but tundra and taiga.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
IRO_overlord_annex_title;Annex the Great Lakes Confederacy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
IRO_overlord_annex_desc;The Great Lakes Indians seem to be getting some very unfirtunate ideas. They are openly asking us to leave the area - clearly, it is time to reorganize the so-called 'confederacy' and integrate their lands directly. \n§RSome neighboring nations may be SEVERELY unhappy about this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
IRO_overlord_release_title;Release the Great Lakes Confederacy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
IRO_overlord_release_desc;Our past position on the issue of the Great Lakes Indians has been too harsh. We may still be able to salvage their goodwill if we release them right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VRI_rally_the_betrodden_title;Rally the Betrodden;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VRI_rally_the_betrodden_desc;In Ayllonia, many slaves still toil the fields and await liberation. We have already started this process by defeating the decadent Republic a few years ago, but now we yet again find ourselves at war with the tyrants. Sound the call, the south shall be free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AYL_integrate_riogrande_title;Integrate Rio Grande;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AYL_integrate_riogrande_desc;The lands on the banks of the Rio Grande that we took from Mexico more than a decade ago are still not properly integrated. With the Mexicans seemingly preparing to strike back, we must take measures to safeguard our lands against any threats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AYL_retake_RGR_title;Retake Rio Grande;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AYL_retake_RGR_desc;We have lost the land that had been taken by us from Mexico all the way in the 1820s. We must strike back and retake what was lost!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AYL_golden_circle_title;The Golden Circle;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AYL_golden_circle_desc;A new radical idea is froming in the minds of our greatest thinkers. The logical contuniation to our endeavors in Mexico clearly follows the coastline of the Mexican Gulf. If we were to continue moving south, maybe we could turn the rich Gulf into our own lake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AYL_annex_yucatan_title;Annex Yucatan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AYL_annex_yucatan_desc;The next step in our grand plan is the conquest of the Yucatan peninsula. Undoubtedly, the natives which densely inhabit these lands will not take us kindly, but we will show them that it is Ayllonia's destiny to achieve the Golden Circle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MEX_integrate_YUC_title;Integrate Yucatan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MEX_integrate_YUC_desc;We have finally subdued the rebellious province of Yucatan that arose after the War for Independence. Let us reintegrate the peninsula into our state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
YUC_integrate_MEX_title;Integrate Mexico;;;;;;;;;;;;;
YUC_integrate_MEX_desc;The Yucatan rebellion has come to an unexpected conclusion: more than a decade after it began, and when the world began to think that the separation between Mexico and Yucatan was almost solidifed, the rebellion, now a state of its own, destroyed its old oppressors. We shall now extend the rights we gave to the Mayans over to the natives of Mexico.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MEX_show_of_force_title;Show of Force;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MEX_show_of_force_desc;The rebellious province of Nueva Vasconia, while having managed to fully separate itself from the Mexican nation, still holds large swathes of lands that are not inhabited by the descendants of the Basques, and the population of which is openly hostile to their government. If we show them what we are capable of, the Vaskonian government will no doubt return us the lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MEX_northern_borderlands_title;The Northern Borderlands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MEX_northern_borderlands_desc;With our core lands reconquered, we may start looking outside of our nation. While we made sure to separate our Republic from the ambitions of the failed Mexican Empire, the need to safeguard our northern border brings us the need to justify further conquests. One possible justification is the protection of smaller nations, such as the Vaskonians - but if we were to think bigger, integration of other peoples as equals may just lead to something bigger...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MEX_take_fluminia_title;Take Fluviales;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MEX_take_fluminia_desc;The next natural step of our expansion would be incorporation of Fluviales, a nation whose population hails from the lands of Lusitania. Integrating them will not be easy, but our efforts to pacify the Rio Grande may bring us some insight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MEX_secure_great_plains_title;Secure the Grandes Llanuras;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MEX_secure_great_plains_desc;New threats loom from the plains of the north, ready to exploit the power vacuum that was left by our victories over Ayllonia. We shall secure the frontier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MEX_annex_california_title;Annex California;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MEX_annex_california_desc;The sparsely populated expanses of California and Nutka hold many untapped resources, many of our brethen and would grant us control over the entire Pacific coast. Let us bring the dream of complete Colombian unity closer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MEX_form_CLM_title;Form the Colombian Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MEX_form_CLM_desc;Once, there was the Mexican Empire, whose quest for domination of the continent of Colombia brought untold death and destruction. Then, there was our state, which based its conquests not on imperial ambitions of any sort, but on a quest of brotherhood and unity for all Colombians. Now, we find ourselves as the sole inheritor of Espania's legacy in Colombia. We must formalize this union - proclaim the Colombian Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM_rockies_borderlands_title;Secure the Rocallosas;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM_rockies_borderlands_desc;The Montanas Rocosas are an integral part of our nation. One bit of them, however, has managed to escape colonization for quite some time. With all pressing matters sorted out, we should take what's left of the Mountains.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAL_annex_NBS_title;Annex Nueva Vasconia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAL_annex_NBS_desc;Originally Mexican province of Nueva Vasconia rebelled during the times of the Mexican Empire. They turned to us for protection, and now time has come to incorporate them into our state as equals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAL_retake_NBS_title;Retake Nueva Vasconia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAL_retake_NBS_desc;We've lost the lands of Nueva Vasconia. The new owners of these lands will surely oppress the vulnerable population - we must take up arms and liberate it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AYL_kill_vrijland_title;End the Bandit State;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AYL_kill_vrijland_desc;The bandit state of Vrijland, having the audacity to call themselves 'liberators', clearly only bring chaos and disorder to the continent. In fact, they have been doing it for well over a century, ever since the colonial authorities of Denmark lost control of their Dutch subjects. Stability will only ensue if Vrijland is wiped off the face of the Earth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VRI_kill_ayllonia_title;Destroy Ayllonia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VRI_kill_ayllonia_desc;With the fall of Ambrosia, it is only a matter of time until someone puts the remnants of the Ayllonian Republic our of their misery. Let it be us, for their lands are still full of enslaved peoples.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VRI_accept_ayllonians_desc;Integrate Ayllonians;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VRI_accept_ayllonians_title;After the destruction of their wretched state, the population of the former Ayllonia finds itself in a state of limbo. While we claim to accept all people equally, clearly, the ideas of their superiority and the desire for exploitation of others lie deeply within Ayllonians. We must remake their society accordingly, so that the evils that arose from these lands may never come to be again.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
VRI_take_AYL_borderlands_title;Cross the Ohio;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VRI_take_AYL_borderlands_desc;The Ayllonian state had managed to convince the Celts to give up some land in the north. Now that we've dealt with Ayllonia itself, we may seize their newly-made colonies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VRI_expand_frontier_title;Expand the Frontier;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VRI_expand_frontier_desc;To our north lies the Lacustrine Confederacy, a thorn in our side and a barrier to our expansion towards the Great Lakes. The lands that are held by these natives would be economically useful to an extensive degree, which means that we need to take action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VRI_manifest_destiny_title;Manifest Destiny;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VRI_manifest_destiny_desc;The last few decades have shown us that that nothing can stand in the way of our forces. Our main adversary, Vrijland, has fallen to the relentless march of freedom. The future is clear: it is our Manifest Destiny to liberate Colombia from oppressors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VRI_liberate_acadia_title;Liberate Acadia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VRI_liberate_acadia_desc;Acadia has long been a colony of Oilitania. And just like us, they have had an extensive history of colonial resistance - let us finally free them from the clutches of Paris!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VRI_great_lakes_title;Expand in the Great Lakes;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VRI_great_lakes_desc;The lands of the Great Lakes turned out to be even more rich and profitable than we thought. We shall settle them in their entirety!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VRI_ildathach_title;Liberate Ildathach;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VRI_ildathach_desc;Ildathach is a relatively young nation, having started to develop its national identity only during the Martletist Wars. This allowed the Celtic Union to keep Ildathach under their thumb. We will liberate them and incorporate them into our Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DES_beachan_title;Colonize Beachan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DES_beachan_desc;We need to secure the lands in immediate proximity to our homelands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DES_ciseachachan_title;Colonize Ciseachachan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DES_ciseachachan_desc;Ciseachachan is a continuation of the northern part of the Great Plains. We must secure it until the Ildathach do it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DES_move_south_title;Move South;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DES_move_south_desc;The plains to our south, known to the Hispanics as Extension Norte, are yet unclaimed by any Colombian powers. We should move in before anyone alse does.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DES_secure_bhinnepeg_title;Secure Bhinnepeg;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DES_secure_bhinnepeg_desc;The borders of Ildathach are getting dangerously close to ours. And yet despite Celtic expansion in the area, the most important lands around the Lake Bhinnepeg are still wild and empty. We cannot miss this opportunity to secure more land for our settlers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RGR_claim_altiplano_title;Claim Altiplano;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RGR_claim_altiplano_desc;Our lands are barren steppes with little to no natural resources, which means that we have no hope of ever becoming a self-sufficient nation. As such, we must claim our southern borderlands and secure the gold mines of Santa Maria del Oro and the iron mines of Zacatecas!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AYL_conquer_taguzgalpa_title;Conquer Taguzgalpa;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AYL_conquer_taguzgalpa_desc;The nation of Taguzgalpa is an unfortunate one, being born an illegitimate and unwanted child of the Espanians and the Moriscos. They do, however, hold lands with significant potential for economic development. They will be better a part of the Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAL_take_hawaii_title;Claim Hawaii;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CAL_take_hawaii_desc;We have maintained continuous presence on the islands of Hawaii for quite some time now. We must secure these islands to exert more influence on the Pacific.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM_conquer_taguzgalpa_title;Conquer Taguzgalpa;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM_conquer_taguzgalpa_desc;The nation of Taguzgalpa is an unfortunate one, being born an illegitimate and unwanted child of the Espanians and the Moriscos. They do, however, hold lands with significant potential for economic development. They will be better a part of Colombia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM_kill_ayllonia_title;Integrate Ayllonia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM_kill_ayllonia_desc;The nation of Ayllonia is, or was, one of the most important Hispanic nations in Colombia. Following the numerous defeats inflicted on them by us, they have completely fallen apart and lost all dignity. We finally bring this vast amount of our Hispanic brethen into the Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MEX_colombian_ambition_title;Colombian Ambition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MEX_colombian_ambition_desc;A new idea has sprung up among our people following our northern conquests. The integration of our brethen, so different yet so alike, clearly overstretches our state, and a simple '$COUNTRY$' is not fit anymore. We must strive for a creation of a greater union between all Hispanocolombians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRP_accept_south_slavs_title;Accept South Slavs;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRP_accept_south_slavs_desc;South Slavic peoples are, just like us, located between more powerful empires. Instead of fighting each other, we should unite to better resist those who try to conquer us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BRB_form_dietsland_desc;Back in the day, there was the Dutch Republic, a nation-state for all Lowlanders, that was successfully crushed by us. A no-brainer solution to our current identity crisis would be to simply take up the mantle of the old Dutch state as a basis for our own. However, there exists a vocal minority who call for an extended union between the Lowlanders and the Low Germans. Perhaps, Dietsland is our true destiny?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

LOM_invite_lucca_title;Invite the Duchy of Lucca;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LOM_invite_lucca_desc;Talks have been ongoing for several years with the small Duchy of Lucca on the matter of them joining the League. There exists heavy opposition to the accession of a new member state, considering the unstable situation inside the League, but the government is sure that securing a favorable treaty with Lucca will be met with jubilation in Milan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ITA_magna_graecia_title;Integrate Magna Graecia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ITA_magna_graecia_desc;The Byzantine Empire had seized the southern tip of Italy all the way back in the 16th century. Since then, many Greek immigrants have arrived in the area, inflating the numbers of the local Griko population, which consists of the remnants of the ancient Greek settlements there. Thankfully, the Grikos have formed quite a distinct identity on their own, and we will be able to easily integrate them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ITA_claim_africa_title;Claim Africa;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ITA_claim_africa_desc;The Kingdom of Africa was a failed project of the Sicilian Hautevilles. Nevertheless, there are many ethnic Italians living in the coastal cities, and with Italy being in an active search for a colony, Tunisia and Tripolitania will become excellent candidates for our new lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LOM_punish_tuscany_title;Punish Tuscany;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LOM_punish_tuscany_desc;The League of Milan is no more, but the consequences of its actions still linger in the air, as the damage from Tuscany's proclamation of a Kingdom has not yet been dealt with. We need to punish Firenze, and the whole Tuscan state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LOM_march_on_rome_title;March on Rome;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LOM_march_on_rome_desc;With Tuscany's demise, Rome, the Eternal City, is within sight. Ruled by the Pope, it is absolutely be a most prized posession for the Byzantine Empire. We need to secure Lazio for ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
komneniad_form_italy_title;Form Italy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
komneniad_form_italy_desc;Italy has not been united since the days of Theoderic. Always a target of foreign conquerors, the small Italian states have been content with the nation being split apart. We need to bring an end to this state of affairs - Italy shall be united!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARE_annex_bern_title;Annex the Bern Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARE_annex_bern_desc;Bern is a loose confederation of German states that came under our sovereignty following the Martletist Wars. With the situation around us rapidly changing, and the German nationalist cause gaining more and more traction, we must liquidate the entity and assume direct control of the Swiss borderlands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARE_unite_the_burgundies_title;Unite the Burgundies;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARE_unite_the_burgundies_desc;The duchies of Lower and Upper Burgundy have been disunited for many centuries. The Kingdom of Arles is technically the direct continuation of the Upper Burgundian state, and we must finally unite the children of the Rhone by claiming the throne of Lorraine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARE_press_savoyard_claims_title;Press the Savoyard Claim;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARE_press_savoyard_claims_desc;The Dukes of Savoy once held domain over both Savoy and Piedmont. Things have changed, and the two provinces are disunited again, but with Savoy being an integral part of the Arelat nation, we hold a substantial claim to the Piedmontese throne. Let us press it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARE_claim_italian_throne_title;Claim the Italian Throne;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ARE_restore_occitania_title;Restore Occitania;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARE_restore_occitania_desc;The Kingdom of Occitania, our sister and a close ally, fell during the Martletist Wars, its lands being forced to join union with Oilitanie. We are the most obvious inheritor of Occitania's legacy, and we must liberate Occitania's domains from the Oilitans, for we are the heirs to Occitania!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARE_annex_catalonia_title;Annex Catalonia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARE_annex_catalonia_desc;Catalonia is a natural extension of Occitania, being culturally, linguistically and economically close to us. Since we already hold substantial influence in the Balearic Sea, it would only be logical if we conquered Catalonia too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARE_latin_empire_title;The Latin Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ARE_latin_empire_desc;Our relentless ambition has brought the Arelat state to unseen heights. We are the masters of the Western Mediterranean, and with the lands we hold being so culturally close, we must unite them based on the common principles we share. Let us proclaim the Latin Empire, an heir to Rome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LTN_accept_spain_title;Accept the Espanians;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LTN_accept_spain_desc;The peoples of Espania are about as Latin as we are. We must integrate them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

FRA_arles_title;Down the Rhone;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FRA_arles_desc;The opportunistic Arles claims that the little mercantile state is the heir to Occitania. We will put them in their place and reintegrate the old Frankish lands of Lower Burgundy into France!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

AAL_formation_title;Propose Creation of Ard al-Hurriyah;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AAL_formation_desc;Following our War for Independence with Andalusia, Sahel al-Wafir and Biru, despite initially acting as a united front, split apart. There is no doubt that the destiny of our people is to unite the two countries into one. If we manage to secure good enough relations with our neighbor, the unification might turn our to be entirely bloodless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AAL_formation_militarily_title;Create Ard al-Hurriyah by force;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AAL_formation_militarily_desc;Unification of Sahel al-Wafir and Biru cannot be done without bloodshed. We must be the first ones to attack!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AAL_annex_guaymura_title;Annex Taguzgalpa;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AAL_annex_guaymura_desc;Taguzgalpa was a nation born from war and bloodshed, and houses a population of half-Hispanics half-Andalusians. This bastard nation can't exist for much longer. Before any opportunists exploit this, we will end their independence to protect the Muslims living there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AAL_annex_welserland_title;Annex Welserland;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AAL_annex_welserland_desc;Welserland is an aristocratic German statelet on our eastern border. Relations with them have never been particularly good, as border conflicts were common. But as their nation is small, annexing it wouldn't be a problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AAL_buy_welserland_title;Buy Welserland;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AAL_buy_welserland_desc;Welserland is an aristocratic German statelet on our eastern border. Relations with them have never been particularly good, as border conflicts were common. But as their nation is small, annexing it wouldn't be a problem. Thankfully, they have yet to gain independence, so we might just be able to buy Welserland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AAL_diplo_annex_WEL_title;Diplomatically Annex Welserland;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AAL_diplo_annex_WEL_desc;Welserland is an aristocratic German statelet on our eastern border. Relations with them have never been particularly good, as border conflicts were common. But as their nation is small, annexing it wouldn't be a problem. Though with their independence from the Germans secured, we might be able to convince them to join us..;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BIR_annex_borderlands_title;Annex the Borderlands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BIR_annex_borderlands_desc;The borderlands of Biru have been claimed first by the colonial administration, then by the independent state of Biru, but true control has never been established. With advancements in technology and a changing world around us, properly integrating these lands is not just a possibility, it's a necessity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BIR_claim_lowlands_title;Claim the Lowlands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BIR_claim_lowlands_desc;Jirijuta is a flat region next to the foothills of Biru. Certainly valuable, it must be secured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AAL_annex_faruduu_title;Annex Faruduu;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AAL_annex_faruduu_desc;Faruduu, meaning 'Swamp Country', is a loosely populated region on the Atlantic Coast, which has somehow managed to survive the various incursions and maintain its independence. Though in the past the crops which are grown locally were an extremely valuable commodity, nowadays these lands are of little interest to anyone. As they are populated by the descendants of the Mande, who follow Islam, we must incorporate this little country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BIR_claim_potosi_title;Claim the Potosi;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BIR_claim_potosi_desc;The Potosi Mountains are famous for having the biggest supply of silver in the world. Securing them would bring us invaluable wealth, and considering the detireorating relations with Antartida, it's a fairly logical thing to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AAL_annex_guatemala_title;Annex Yucatan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AAL_annex_guatemala_desc;In the centuries prior, when Andalusia and Espania waged war in the Antillean, our ancestors used the sour relations between the Natives of Mesocolombia and their Espanian overlords to their advantage by spreading the Islamic faith among the Mayans. And despite the fact that Andalusia was never able to firmly establish itself on the Yucatan, the ceonsequences of these actions are still felt, with many Mayans still being Muslim. As tensions between the Yucatec Hispanics and the Natives grow, the latter group may just welcome us as liberators.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AAL_accept_mayans_title;Accept the Mayans;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AAL_accept_mayans_desc;With Yucatan secured, we may finally integrate the local populace into our administration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AAL_accept_andeans_title;Accept the Andeans;;;;;;;;;;;;;

PER_form_persia_title;Form Persia;;;;;;;;;;;;;

PER_secure_gulf_title;Secure the Persian Gulf;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PER_secure_gulf_desc;The Persian Gulf is a lucrative trade lifeline of our entire Empire. We cannot allow the mercantile Arab lords on the southern coast to threaten our shipping routes. We should subjugate them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PER_subdue_pashtuns_title;Subdue the Pashtuns;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PER_subdue_pashtuns_desc;The eastern border of Persia has never been properly controlled by any of the Persian Empires of old. To better protect our flank, we need to invade these lands and extablosh complete control over the local populace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

PER_accept_turkmen_desc;The nomadic Turkmen tribes have troubled Persia for over a millenium. We will Persianise them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

PER_eat_assyria_title;Conquer Assyria;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PER_eat_assyria_desc;Assyria is a rogue state, with Assyrians barely contributing the majority of the population. With them holding lands that are populated by our Kurdish brethen, we should end the existence of this polity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PER_caucasus_title;Invade the Caucasus;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PER_caucasus_desc;The people of the Caucasus are, just like those of Mesopotamia, Transoxiana and Afghaistan, inseparably connected to Persia. We should take the Armenian and Shirvani lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PER_retake_mazandaran_title;Retake Mazandaran;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PER_retake_mazandaran_desc;Mazandaran was conquered by Russia when the Persian state collapsed due to pressure from all sides in the 18th century.

ZND_eastern_frontier_title;The Eastern Frontier;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ZND_eastern_frontier_desc;With our core lands reconquered, we may look further to the east, where Afghan tribes bicker and sow chaos across the lands. If we've learned anything from the Manghit invasion, it's that you cannot allow thing like this to foster on your border. We need to take preemptive measures and attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGT_proclaim_empire_title;Proclaim the Manghit Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MGT_proclaim_empire_desc;With the end of the Zand dynasty, we, the Manghits, are the only force left in Persia. Just as many conquerors before us have done, we shall absorb the Persian culture and create a Persianate empire, seizing the future of these lands from the locals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AST_claim_new_holland_title;Claim New Holland;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AST_claim_new_holland_desc;The lands of New Holland were once claimed by the Occitan Empire, but revolution at home forced the colonisation efforts to be postponed, and, with the fall of Occitania, be completely abandoned. We can't allow any European or otherwise colonial power to hold lands in immediate proximity to us. We need to take New Holland ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AST_claim_occitania_title;Liberate Occitania;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AST_claim_occitania_desc;When Occitania fell, the colonial governor of Meridionalia, Aimar Chambon, vowed to never abandon the Metropole. When the treacherous Great Powers of Europe fave Occitania to the vile Oilitans, Aimar Chambon refused to recognise the unlawful annexation. And even as the newly-formed 'France' declared that it had no interest in reclaiming Occitania's colonial Empire, Aimar Chambon didn't abandon the Fatherland, calling on all patriotic Occitans of the world to take part in a grand reclamation of the country. Despite the opposition, we shall officialize this ambition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AST_form_occitania_title;Form Occitania;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AST_form_occitania_desc;Despite all odds, the revolution, the foreign occupation and the exile in Meridionalia, the Occitan nation has endured, finding its way home one way or another. The ancient realm shall be restored - let us proclaim a free Occitania!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ZPD_annex_prussia_desc;Recent happenings in Germany clearly highlight how our diplomatic inactivity on this front and disinterest in the German affairs brought a severe threat to our border. If Bavaria is busy now, we need to solve the greatest issue of the all: the existance of Prussia, who deny us sea access.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ZPD_great_national_reform_title;The Great National Reform;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ZPD_great_national_reform_desc;Not every one of the many nationalities of Zapadoslavia is yet properly represented in the administration, with there being many remnants of old feudal political organisation in place, such as the massive Crown of Bohemia of the Galician Autonomy. We need to reform the internal organisation of the state completely, so that many of the old and temporary institutions are replaced by a modern federal organisation, where all Slavs are equals. Th reform would include moving the capital to the nation's center - Krakow.;;;;;;;;;;;;
ZPD_create_ngf_title;Federalise North Germany;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ZPD_take_sorbia_desc;The Sorbs are a tiny West Slavic ethnic group who hail from the old Slavic population of Germany, the Wends.

ZPD_liberate_sorbia_title;Liberate Sorbia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ZPD_liberate_sorbia_desc;The Sorbs are a tiny West Slavic ethnic group who hail from the old Slavic population of Germany, the Wends.

LIT_annex_courland_title;Claim Courland;;;;;;;;;;;;;

RUS_finish_unification_desc;Centuries ago, The Grand Duchy of Lithuania began its incursion into East Slavic lands, taking advantage of the Mongol invasion and subjugating many lands, even managing to threaten Moscow itself.

RUS_window_to_europe_title;A Window to Europe;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RUS_window_to_europe_desc;The Baltic ports in Livonia would certainly help Russian commerce. Klyuchevsk was a failed endeavour at getting such ports, but with there being no powers strong enough to stop us now, we must invade the Baltic Union and properly secure Baltic Sea Trade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ATA_colonize_lespandida_desc;L'Espandida is a flat, grassy plain to our south. Antartidan settlers have began venturing into these land a long time ago, and it's time for the Antartidan state to follow them and establish a proper administration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ATA_colonize_patagonia_title;Colonize Patagonia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ATA_colonize_patagonia_desc;Patagonia evaded colonization due to fierce resistance of the native tribes in the area. Considering how strategically important the southern tip of Araiana is, we must secure the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ATA_core_nogojidaga_title;Integrate Nogojidaga;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ATA_core_nogojidaga_desc;Nogojidaga is a marshy region to our north. Located on the crossroads of the major Araianan nations, it's only a matter of time until one of them takes these lands over. And we need to make sure it is going to be us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ATA_expand_orungu_title;Expand Influence in Orungu;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ATA_expand_orungu_desc;Orungu is a small kingdom in Gabon that was taken over by our forces in the last decade. The reason why they are so important for us is the fact that they offer to buy slaves at a lucrative price. If we were to build up the coastal areas we have already established control over, we could seize the slave supply ourselves, which would be useful for any future projects of ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ATA_prospect_famatina_title;Prospect Famatina;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ATA_prospect_famatina_desc;Famatina is an area at the border of Cura and Catamarca regions that reportedly could contain valuable industrial resources. If Antartida ever wants to be a self-sustaining power able to project its influence over the entire South Atlantic, it needs a strong heavy industry, capable of producing both land and sea armaments. We should send prospectors to Famatina and the neighboring areas to find the hidden deposits, so that we don't have to import coal, iron and sulphur from abroad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ATA_slaves_for_famatina_title;Slaves for Famatina;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ATA_slaves_for_famatina_desc;After we have successfully established mines in the western part of Antartida, an expected problem became apparent: lack of labourers. Not many people coming into Antartida want to travel all the way to the far west, into arid steppe and mountain regions to toil away in the mines. As such, we will apply a more traditional solution: slave labour. Importing tens of thousands of negroes wouldn't be a problem considering our recent takeover of Gabon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ATA_prospect_trencavelia_title;Prospect Trencavelia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ATA_prospect_trencavelia_desc;The Andes might have substantial deposits of natural resources, but we could look even closer to find what we search for. In the hills of Trencavelia Menor there are already significant coal deposits being developed. And in the plains of Trencavelia Mager, a town by the name of Minas de Corral was recently established, apparently located on a massive iron deposit. We need to look into these areas further and set up mines in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ATA_slaves_for_trencavelia_title;Slaves for Trencavelia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ATA_slaves_for_trencavelia_desc;After we have successfully established mines in Trencavelia, an expected problem became apparent: lack of labourers. Not many people coming into Antartida want to travel to the supposed paradise-like regions only to toil away in the mines. As such, we will apply a more traditional solution: slave labour. Importing tens of thousands of negroes wouldn't be a problem considering our recent takeover of Gabon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ATA_giant_of_the_south_title;Hegemon of the South;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ATA_giant_of_the_south_desc;Ever since its establishment, Antartida has dreamed of becoming a self-sustaining, strong and peaceful country in the Southern Cone. Through tireless labour, ambitious ventures across the sea and conquests at home, we have succeded in becoming just that - the Hegemon of the South, an uncontested master of the Southern Seas and an undefeatable power on the continent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ATA_accept_afro_occitan_title;Integrate Former Slaves;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ATA_accept_afro_occitan_desc;With slavery in our country gone, we can integrate the descendants of African slaves we've brought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AST_colonize_interior_title;Colonize the Interior;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AST_colonize_interior_desc;The interior of Meridionalia is a harsh desert, not suitable for agriculture and troublesome to settle. We must, however, establish control over it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

AST_colonize_interior_2_desc;The interior of Meridionalia is a harsh desert, not suitable for agriculture and troublesome to settle. We must, however, establish control over it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
italia_irredenta_next_title;Italia Irredenta;;;;;;;;;;;;;
italia_irredenta_next_desc;With Italy Proper unified, the Italian State must look outwards. There are still many lands that have a considerable Italian population that are still part of other nations. We must unite all Italians no matter what!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_accept_assyrians_title;Accept the Assyrians;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BYZ_accept_assyrians_desc;Centuries ago, the Middle East was an integral part of the Empire, populated by Christians and Aramaic-speaking peoples. This changed with the Arab Invasion, which swept away not just the Imperial Rule, but the very pillars upon which the local populace rested, which led to a gradual assimilation of the region. Though Ethiopian rule allowed the Christian populace to flourish, Islam nevertheless remained dominant. A reconquest of the region will be costly, but the locals would welcome us as liberators.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
