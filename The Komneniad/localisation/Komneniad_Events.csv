153000DESC;In the troubled lands of the Danube River basin, peace was never an option. \nLong dominated by the Kingdom of Hungary, the diverse peoples of the area have been fonced to work in the fields for days on end in order to fulfill the ever-increasing demands of the foreign nobles. The regime came crashing down in 1788, however, when a combined Byzantine-Bohemian invasion forced the decadent kingdom to cede the borderlands - the king was murdered and an even more oppressive regency was established, which was in turn overthrown by a group of radical republicans. Hungary then became a hotbed of przewrotian activity, waging war against its neighbours until being crushed by the Byzantines, its Rumanian subjects carving out their own statelets. \nNow, more than a decade later, a new, radical idea is being born in the minds of the idealists - one of brotherhood and unity across the Carpathian mountains. \nAnd the unthinkable option may turn out to be the only right one.;;;;;;;;;;;;
153001NAME;Invitation to the Szeged Conference;;;;;;;;;;;;;
153001DESC;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has embraced the unthinkable idea of creating a unified Carpathian state, calling for a conference In Szeged. Do we accept the invitation, or do we embrace our own nationalist desires? \n§RWe will get annexed if Carpathia forms.;;;;;;;;;;;;

153003NAME;$FROMCOUNTRY$ declines!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
153003DESC;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has declined our invitation, declaring our idea to be insane and not even theoretically possible. Some figures in their government even called for arresting our diplomats, citing our attempts at reconciling the diffrences between the two Carpathian nations being insulting. However, the members of our delegation have managed to successfully slip out of the country. What do we do now?;;;;;;;;;;;;
153004NAME;$FROMCOUNTRY$ declares war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
153004DESC;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ lunatics have declared a war on us in response to s denying their insane idea of 'Rumanian-Hungarian unity'. Is this is what it takes to rid the world of this insanity, then we will fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;
153005NAME;Failure of the Szeged Conference;;;;;;;;;;;;;
153005DESC;One of the required signatories has refused to show up to the cinference, instead choosing to pursue its nation's own nationalist ideas. The Carpathian Dream has died in its infancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;
153006NAME;The Carpathian Coalition is defeated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
153006DESC;After a gruesome war of our national survival, the so-called 'Carpathian Coalition' has backed down and recalled its desired to unify the historical enemies. Non we are free to pursue our people's destiny!;;;;;;;;;;;;
153200DESC;The Danube river basin has long been dominated by the Kingdom of Hungary (ruled by the Occitan Fois dynasty), the diverse peoples of the area being forced to work in the fields for days on end in order to fulfill the ever-increasing demands of the foreign nobles. The regime came crashing down in 1788, however, when a combined Byzantine-Bohemian invasion forced the decadent kingdom to cede the borderlands - the king was murdered and an even more oppressive regency was established, which was in turn overthrown by a group of radical republicans. Hungary then became a hotbed of przewrotian activity, waging war against its neighbours until being crushed by the Byzantines, its Rumanian subjects carving out their own statelets. \nLajos Batthyany, a Hungarian noble, was crowned as king as a result of the Constantinople Accords. He is known as a staunch patriot and a capable leader, and it remains to be seen what he makes of his beloved nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;
165000DESC;The empire, long divided, must unite. Long united, must divide. \n- Opening lines of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms \nAs the Chinese history always goes, it all started with a new dynastic cycle. The moment the Shun overthrew the Ming in 1644, it became riddled with the timeless plagues of its predecessors. Unable to overcome them, the Shun slowly waned, - the first victim came to be the territorial integrity, as the merchant states of Nanyue and Minyue established themselves in the South. Then, a breach of the Great Wall by the Tanguts, followed by a hasty retreat to Nanjing and the beginning of a new Warlord Era. \nWith the status quo being broken by a Korean invasion of the North, it becomes obvious that change is once again coming to China. It matters not who comes out on top, - the Koreans, the petty warlords or the Tanguts. One thing is certain - unification is nigh.;;;;;;;;;;;;
165001DESC;The beginning of the war in the North means that the strongest of the Shun breakaways, Yan, is now preoccupied with an enemy as strong as them. No matter the repercussions of this war, for the time being we are free to wage whatever war we desire, and as such, it is now time to end the long period of disunity in Central China and unite the petty warlords under our banner. \n§R We will receive a permanent annexation casus belli on every other contender in Central China.;;;;;;;;;;;;
165002DESC;We, the merchant states of the South, are unconcerned with the affairs of the North. Instead, our business lies in the South China Sea, where the Yue and the Min have traditionally held much influence. Over the years, as we expanded our operations in these areas, we grew ever more distant from the Greater Chinese nation, and eventually the local dialects evolved into a true national identity, separate from the Han. \nThe 'Yue', as we call the region, is a completely different area from the rest of China. We know that due to our advanced methods of warfare, which we learned from the West, we are safe from attacks from the North mo matter what, - however, it does not mean we must sit idly and watch our northern neighbours' power grow. The people of the South must be united, and we will make sure that it is us who are at the forefront of this unification.;;;;;;;;;;;;
165003DESC;As the Ming Empire collapsed, its most loyal men fled to the island of Taiwan, known to the Westerners as Formosa. Here, the great general Koxinga established the Kingdom of Tungning, a temporary state before the planned return to the mainland. Things have turned out much differently, however, as the coastline became dominated not by the waning Shun, but by the merchant states of Yue and Min, who have since maintained a blockade (though poorly-enforced) on our nation. \nAs we enter the next period of Chinese history, it seems like Ming's chances of returning are slim. Nevertheless, we shall not give up our hope and accept defeat - for it is the underdog who will come out on top! \n§R Tungning currently has no content. You will get no flavour when pursuing the reclamation.;;;;;;;;;;;;
165004DESC;The Kingdom of Dali, a third bearing such name, rests in the mountains of Yunnan, away from the warmongering Northerners and the greedy Yue. What we are close to, however, is the Burmese Empire, who has relentlessly tried to assault our impregnable mountain fortresses. While they did see some success, the only thing they ever achieved was annexation of several borderland regions at the cost of countless lives lost. \nNow that their 'empire' is idle, we may finally turn our attention inwards. And the most pressing matter is plainly obvious: it is the massive amount of Muslim missionaries funded by Andalusia from their stronghold in Macao. We are not sure what the repercussions of this aggressive proselytisation are going to be, but not choosing a side is not an option, it seems. \n§R Dali currently has no content. You will not receive any unique events or decisions throughout your entire playthrough.;;;;;;;;;;;;
165005DESC;The Tanguts have never really amounted to much. They have been one of many Mongol tribes that roamed the Gobi Desert, raiding the nearby China and fighting among themselves - in short, doing the same thing they have done for the past millenia. \nThings changed very suddenly and very unexpectedly. First came the conversion to Vajrayana Buddhism, then - an attack on Ningxia. The tribemen were shocked to see the defenders flee without much pressure put on them, and soon, virtually without any real opposition, the Kingdom of Iryai was established, named after its capital. \nChange did not stop there, as instead of continuing the traditional nomadic lifestyle, the tribes decided to finally settle and pursue a more harmonious society, one free from war and hatred. The results can already be felt, as the steppes lie fully subjugated. But the conquest of China is a completely different task, - one not fit for a nomad.;;;;;;;;;;;;
165006DESC;The Shun Empire was born in 1644, when Li Zicheng, the leader of a massive peasant rebellion against Ming, proclaimed himself Emperor. The Empire did not last long, however, as we were soon met by increasing pressure from all sides. Despite the fact that we stayed unconquered by any outsiders, the disastrous Tangut seizure of Ningxia in the 18th century brought the Empire to its knees, and we were forced to retreat to Nanjing under the pressure of peasant rebellions. Now we must rebuild what we lost and strike down the pretenders and warlords alike! \n§RA unique opportunity presents itself in the North. We shall make our decision soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;
165007DESC;The Yan Kingdom is the strongest of the so-called 'central kingdoms', poised to become the victor of the decades-long struggle. Our favourable position in the North came to be our demise, however, as the opportunistic Koreans are now standing at the Shanhai Pass in an attempt to seize the Middle Kingdom for themselves. This cannot stand: we must defeat them and finish our unification of China! \n§RIf the Shanhai Pass falls, we will face growing unrest on the homefront, which may lead to a complete collapse of our country.;;;;;;;;;;;;
165008DESC;Never before have the lands of the Yue been unified under a single authority, other than under the Han. Their bloody conquests have not been forgotten though, and we shall make our distinct identities a point of pride. We will forge an Empire of our own in the South China Sea, one to rival both the Northerners and the Europeans.;;;;;;;;;;;;
165009DESC;Hangzhou was the only city that the Shun Dynasty managed to recover in the South after the states of Minyue and Nanyue were established. Despite the long period of occupation and suppression of the local Wu identity, the city's inhabitants have not forgotten the taste of freedom that once could be sensed in the streets. And now, as the city is once again in our hands, nationwide celebrations erupt as we score another major victory against the Han.;;;;;;;;;;;;
165010DESC;The Koreans have successfully broken through the Shanhai Pass using their imported artillery. We can only hope that they don't get any more of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;
165011DESC;Disaster strikes: our last line of defense has collapsed. The Korean Imperial Army has entered Beijing, their 'Emperor' making sure to enter the Forbidden City already, and it seems like they are preparing to proclaim him the Emperor of China as well. This may very well be the end of our kingdom. \n§RWe have detected some suspicious movements on our Southern border. It seems like the end is nigh.;;;;;;;;;;;;
165012DESC;Reports are coming to the Imperial court that our Northern adversary, the Yan Kingdom, is rapidly disintegrating. The Korean army has taken Beijing, and the number of loyalists rapidly dwindles. It is obvious that this is the moment we have been waiting for: it is time to strike North and reclaim our rightful lands before the Koreans get to them! \n§RIf Yan controls less than 70% of their country, we will receive massive defections in form of entire provinces and brigades!;;;;;;;;;;;;
165013DESC;The worst of our fears have become true, as the disloyal elements within our society are sensing the coming collapse of our state and actively switching to the enemy's side. We are left powerless. \n§RProvinces occupied by the Shun will now secede to them, together with the brigades which were recruited in them.;;;;;;;;;;;;
165014TITLE;$PROVINCENAME$ defects!;;;;;;;;;;;;
165014DESC;The rapid disintegration of our country prompted many disloyal elements within our country to betray our cause and switch to the enemy's side. Another province has sided with the invaders, causing us to lose control over the troops recruited from it as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;
165015DESC;Despite the overwhelming odds against us, we have managed to stop the invaders and recover from our malaise. With the defectors purged, we may finally continue the Reunification! \n§RWe have unlocked the Chinese Reunification CB!;;;;;;;;;;;;
165016DESC;The bloody Wars of the Central Kingdoms are now over, with us emerging as the victor. Now it is time to look to the North and finish what we started! \n§RWe have received an annexation casus belli on Shun and Yan.;;;;;;;;;;;;
165017DESC;All of our adversaries have fallen, save for the Koreans. The unification of China draws ever closer! \n§RWe have unlocked the Chinese Reunification CB!;;;;;;;;;;;;
165018DESC;Ever since the collapse of the Shun Empire in the 17th century, the Middle Kingdom has been engulfed by chaos and strife, suffering from yet another warlord period. Such things are not to last, however, as we have managed to subdue all of our rivals by force and unify China, hopefully for the last time. \nWith stability and order finally restored, we look forwards to avenging the injustices of the last two centuries, by force or diplomacy. Let Asia tremble before the might of the restored Chinese Empire, like they have before!;;;;;;;;;;;;
165019DESC;The end of the Ming Empire and the weakness of the Shun have left Korea in a vulnerable postition. Without a powerful Chinese protector to guarantee stability, Korea was seemingly beset by enemies on all sides. Such an unfavourable position forced Joseon to make some changes to their policies. The most important of them, - the decision to invade the disunited Manchu tribes, before they got up to anything of their own. The campaigns were a remarkable success, despite the fact that the Empire was forced to share the spoils with the Russians, and one and a half centuries of settlement followed. \nBut this was in the 18th century. Now, the young King Munjo sensed a completely different opportunity: the disunited states of China. A modern army and stability at the homefront will crush any warlord, but an ambition as great as unification of China and Korea may prove to be too much to handle for the young Emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;
165021DESC;The Northern capital of China, Beijing, has finally fallen to our armies. The rapid collapse of the Yan Kingdom, thought to be the most likely candidate for Chinese unification, has caused great shock in the world. However, it seems like an event even more unexpected is about to be witnessed: the current King of Korea, Munjo, has publicly announced in the war-torn Forbidden Palace his desires to challenge the Shun remnants in Nanjing for the title of Celestial Emperor, which would mean that Korea may very soon be one country with China.;;;;;;;;;;;;
165022DESC;Recently introduced military reforms have brought the Western weapons with them. Despite gunpowder technology originating in China, our traditional guns and cannons are inferior to their Western counterparts in every way. This means that we can no longer effectively supply our troops, as many producers are swithcing to making more high-quality (and more expensive) Western firearms. \n§RWe can now build an arsenal in our capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;
165023TITLE;The $CAPITAL$ Arsenal;;;;;;;;;;;;
165023DESC;We have decided to invest into building an arsenal in our capital. What should we focus on?;;;;;;;;;;;;
165023A;Let's focus on §BAmmunition§! production.;;;;;;;;;;;;
165023B;Let's focus on §BSmall Arms§! production.;;;;;;;;;;;;
165023C;Let's focus on §BArtillery§! production.;;;;;;;;;;;;
165024DESC;Disaster strikes! Our armies have been beaten out of China by our rivals, all of our successes undone, though now many question if the were any sussecces at all, considering our current state of affairs. The country weeps, and any dreams of once again moving into China have been crushed. The future is uncertain.;;;;;;;;;;;;
165025DESC;It seems like our conquest of China has turned quite... anticlimactic. While we have been able to seize some land in China proper, our main target, Beijing, is not in our hands. It's not over yet: we can still rectify our mistakes and prepare the next strike. The most difficult part is over already!;;;;;;;;;;;;
165026DESC;A few days ago, Nanjing, the temporary capital of the Shun Dynasty, has fallen to the Imperial Army, and with it, the two centuries-long Shun had come to an end. What many would think to be a simple end of one dynastic cycle and the beginning of another, however, was something completely new in Chinese history, as King Munjo was determined to make sure that no new dynastic cycle would ever begin in China. \nAlready being the Emperor of Joseon and the only legitimate claimant to the Mandate of Heaven left, Munjo was crowned the Celestial Emperor in Beijing, formally uniting Korea and China into one being - Tultaehan, or The Two Great Han. This is a beginning of a new era for the peoples of East Asia, one of peace, prosperity and brotherhood.;;;;;;;;;;;;
165027DESC;The powerful Kingdom of Yan has finally fallen to the combined arms of Korea and Shun. With this powerful adversary out of the way, we can finally properly begin the process of reclamation.;;;;;;;;;;;;
165029DESC;The Kingdom of Iryai was established as an experiment unlikely to succeed: a feudal state founded by Buddhist nomads, pursuing rapid westernization. However, the underdog came out on top in the Wars of Chinese Unification, as the world now hears of a creation of the Xie Empire. \nFocused on spreading Vajrayana Buddhist teachings inherited from Tibet, the newly-formed state promised to bring peace and, most importantly, harmony between the millenia-long enemies: the Chinese and the Mongols. Whatever the outcome of this is, the political landscape of East Asia is sure to experience an inward turn.;;;;;;;;;;;;
165030DESC;The Xie Dynasty, our hated Mongol oppressors, have been recently overthrown. The country's majority, the Han, have as such established a national state of their own. At last, China is truly free from any sorts of oppression!;;;;;;;;;;;;
165027DESC;Many years have passed since the last warlord has been defeated and annexed into our nation. The wounds of this horrible era are starting to heal, as the people of China slowly forget about disunity. May a calamity of this magnitude never happen to China ever again.;;;;;;;;;;;;
165031DESC;The Final Battle has been lost. Our lands are occupied, our armies are beaten and our morale is nonexistent - this is the last defeat for the Shun Dynasty. But not because we are assured of our coming victories - no, it is because the Shun has lost. With only the port of Hangzhou left in the Empire's grasp, the state has virtually dissolved itself, the Emperor commiting suicide a few weeks prior. Being decapitated, it also means we cannot defend ourselves from the inevitable Min onslaught, as they rush to reclaim their long-lost fortress. \nIronically, the place where Shun made its only success also became our grave.;;;;;;;;;;;;
165032DESC;The AI is remarkably stupid, so they need some help. This event will fire every two months until the war is over and will give KOR and HEB a bunch of equipment so their armies reinforce.;;;;;;;;;;;;
165033DESC;You're an AI and have been at peace for too long, despite the fact that the starting event told you to get the bloodbath going. You cannot read, sure, and this exactly why this event exists. You will now select a random Central Kingdom to dec on. Sorry if you have 0 brigades or some shit, idc honestly.;;;;;;;;;;;;
165034DESC;One of our neighboring kingdoms, $FROM$, is amassing troops at our border. It is clear: we must prepare for the coming war!;;;;;;;;;;;;
165035DESC;Now that the tags are properly set up, you can dec.;;;;;;;;;;;;
165049DESC;The Kongsis operating on the island of Bo-Ni have expanded their operations to the local province of $PROVINCENAME$.;;;;;;;;;;;;
166000DESC;The Konbaung Empire, now the monster that lies to our West, has destroyed the last unified Thai satte, Ayutthaya, in 1767. On the ruing of Ayutthaya arose several warring states, each wanting to kick the Burmese our and restore a Thai state - but non acomplished that. In fact, only two of them survive now - Phimai and Ligor. \nRuled by Morakot, the son of Prayong, titular king of Ayutthaya, Phimai survived only because Burma cound be bothered to deal with the lands to their East after a period of instability that their Empire suffered in the 1770s. Morakot is no ordinary individual, however: his desire to reclaim what was lost during the times of his forefathers is well-known to all, and he may very much have the support he needs to at least partially acomplish his ambitions. \nTime will tell if the Thai can forge themselves a state again.;;;;;;;;;;;;
166001DESC;The French colonial holding in Saigon is a relatively new happening in the region, as they have exploited Cambodia's weak hold over the Cham lands on the coast. While the impact of French presence is not really felt politically, as the French don't seem to care about warring kingdoms in the region, it is very much felt in other spheres of life, as we have recently started receiving Christian missionaries trying to proselythise in the region. Most of the neighboring rulers have outright rejected the enroaching Europeans, but Morakot is of a different opinion of them. Perhaps, if we were to accept their influence, this would help us overcome the technological gap between ourselves and the Europeans.;;;;;;;;;;;;
166002DESC;As news of further European involvement in Asian affairs come in, the King of Vientiane, Khi Menh, has assumed that the the Burmese Empire will be distracted with wars with much stronger European powers. His father, Anouvong, got killed by the Burmese after attempting a raid into their territory. In an attempt to avenge his father Anauvong's death, who was killed by the Burmese after attempting a raid into their territory, Khi Menh has launched a raid on his own, attempting to weaken Burma for a potential further conflict. Time will tell if he succeeds.;;;;;;;;;;;;

166004DESC;Disaster! Khi Menh's raid against Burma has failed miserably. He suffered the same fate as his father, being executed by the much larger and more organized Burmese army, with the rest of his force mercilessly massacred. Due to him having no sons, an interregnum now begins in Vientiane, as noble struggle to put their favoured candidate on the throne. We can only hope that our rivals don't exploit that.;;;;;;;;;;;;
166005DESC;We are receiving wonderful news from Vientiane: Khi Menh's raid against Burma has failed miserably. He suffered the same fate as his father, being executed by the much larger and more organized Burmese army, with the rest of his force mercilessly massacred. Due to him having no sons, an interregnum now begins in Vientiane, as noble struggle to put their favoured candidate on the throne. It means that they are left very vulnerable to outside threats: maybe it is soon going to be the time to strike...;;;;;;;;;;;;
166006DESC;Our ally, the Kingdom of Vientiane, has recently attempted a raid against Burma, with their king, Khi Menh, leading the charge. \nIt failed miserably. \nHe suffered the same fate as his father, being executed by the much larger and more organized Burmese army, with the rest of his force mercilessly massacred. Due to him having no sons, an interregnum now begins in Vientiane, as noble struggle to put their favoured candidate on the throne. As pur dynasty is intertwined with theirs, it presents a perfect opportunity to attck, and maybe unify the Lao states. Nevermind that he was our ally.;;;;;;;;;;;;
166007DESC;The civil war in Vientiane has taken an unexpected turn. Their ally, Champassak, has presented a claimant of its own, attacking their former ally in an attempt to unify the Lao. Their armies are distracted, and it means that the time is ripe to begin the unification of the Thai and invade the lands on the Khorat Plateau that would be a great boon to our country.;;;;;;;;;;;;
166008DESC;Our unexpected conquest of the Khorat Plateau has shaken the court in Vientiane, as the succession crisis worsens. A group of defeatists, whose support among the common people rapidly grew, have managed to seize power in the kingdom, and now they have asked for support from us. This effectively means that we have gained complete control over our former rival, Vientiane.;;;;;;;;;;;;

This effectively means that we have gained complete control over our former rival, Champassak.;;;;;;;;;;;;
166010DESC;Our colonial office in Saigon, Cochinchina, has recently started receiving interesting messages from inside of the Indochinese Peninsula. It seems like the small Princedom of Phimai, ruled by an ambitious individual named Morakot, has managed to defeat its Lao neighbors against the odds and establish itself as a dominant state in the area. While such happenings are not uncommon in Asia, and we wouldn't expect Morakot's conquests to last, Phimai is no ordinary princedom: it is the only remaining claimant to the throne of Ayutthaya, the last Thai kingdom that got destroyed by the Burmese Empire in 1767. People knowledgeable about the area say that the tide of Thai nationalism will soon become too much to handle for the Burmese, and the most realistic outcome for the region is a restoration of Siam spearheaded by Phimai. Morakot has also been keen to accept our Christian missionaries sent to his state. Many are proposing to offer him support, as he may come in handy later.;;;;;;;;;;;
166011DESC;Great news from Saigon! It seems like our recent conquests have not gone unnoticed, and the French government in Paris has decided to offer us support in the form of advisors and technology. It seems like they consider us to be the most likely victor in the coming wars in the region, and think that we may be helpful to them in some way. No matter what their true desires are, we shall gladly accept their help.;;;;;;;;;;;;
166012DESC;Rejoice! The grandest city of the Thai, Bangkok, is now in our hands. The Burmese occupants have been kicked out for good, and for the first time in a century, the old city is controlled by an independent Thai kingdom. Now it is time to make sure that no other disaster like that befalls the lands - we shall proclaim the Kingdom of Siam, the greatest Thai state.;;;;;;;;;;;;
166013DESC;The Kingdom of Mrauk U, also known as Arakan, was a small state on the eastern coast of the Bay of Bengal, existing as an independent polity since the 15th century. The kingdom has long evaded Burmese subjugation, while also not playing in active role in Burmese politics, instead focusing on the Mughal threat to the North. However, a series of defeats in thr 17th century promted the end of the kingdom's Golden Age, forcing the small state into political isolation, which was only broken by the enterprising Danish merchants in the following century, and the later support by the Danish government led to an eventual annexation of the kingdom into Denmark. \nA serious threat and a major humuliation for the Konbaung Empire, Arakan was considered to be a high-value target by the Burmese. And today, this story finally ends, as the city of Mrauk U is officially annexed into Burma, one way or another. This opens up a new path for expansion for Burma - into the Indian subcontinent.;;;;;;;;;;;;
166014DESC;We are receiving news of a major war to our West, involving the Burmese Empire fighting a country considerably more powerful than them. Perhaps this is the moment we have been waiting for, and we shall soon reclaim our lost lands?;;;;;;;;;;;;
166015DESC;An interesting man has come to our Foreign Ministry: a Thai ambassador proposing a plan for partition of Cambodia, a sizeable kingdom in Indochina. While our governors of Saigon have long held desires to expand our colonial holdings in Cochinchina, the state has never really taken any active measures to do it. Now, however, we are presented with an interesting opportunity to expand in the region: a border extended all the way to the Mekong river would certainly benefit us.;;;;;;;;;;;;
166016DESC;The French have accepted our deal! We have met in their colonial holding of Saigon, where we have agreed on the partition of Cambodia. While we were sure that the French were going to demand Cochinchina, we were deeply saddened to find that they have decided to put the border on the Mekong River, thus taking a valuable chunk of Khmer-populated lands to the East of the river. Nevertheless, this will help us expand our domain! \n§RIf we sign a separate white peace with Cambodia, France will no longer abide by the stipulations of the treaty, annexing the entirety of Cambodia for themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;
166017DESC;The French have refused our proposal, saying it 'is not in their interests'. We will have to defeat Cambodia on our own.;;;;;;;;;;;;
166018DESC;Angkor has fallen to our armies. Now we shall carve up Cambodia as agreed in the treaty of Saigon.;;;;;;;;;;;;
166019DESC;Our diplomatic efforts in Indochina have taken a serious hit, as we receive messages of Siamese forces being defeated by the Cambodians. It is unexpected, yes, but what it really means is that we can no longer abide by the stipulations of the treaty. That is, of course, if we manage to win this war.;;;;;;;;;;;;
166020DESC;Tragedy has befallen on the Cambodian nation. Our core lands and the city of Angkor have been overtaken by a hostile power, and we are reduced only to our holdings in Cochinchina. These lands are very unruly, however, as they are mostly populated by the tribal Cham peoples. Many are proposing embracing the Cham identity and letting go of our holdings in Cambodia.;;;;;;;;;;;;
166021DESC;We have received a most terrible telegram. Our French 'friends', or so we thought, having consolidated their domain in Dainam, have proposed a 'delineation of the border', which in European terms means that they are demanding land from us. From what we know, they want to establish the border on the Mekong river, which would take away a considerable chunk of our territory. The choice is ours: do we accept the humiliation or do we fight the all-powerful France?;;;;;;;;;;;;
166022DESC;The Siamese have refused our demands, meaning that our only choice now is war. Unless we want to suffer an international humiliation, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;
166023DESC;The State of Ligor arose in the 1770s during a period of instability in the Burmese Empire caused by their recent conquests. As a Thai contender in the South, they had their own plans of restoring Ayutthaya, but fate thought otherwise: Burma stabilized, their hold on the Thai lands strengthened, and all dreams of their collapse did not come to be, as Ligor was left cornered against the Konbaung monster. And for the next few decades, they did nothing. All plans of greatness were abandoned, the army rotted and the nobles became increasingly decadent. It is a miracle they did not get swept away by the Burmese, really. \nAnd now, there is Siam. A unified Thai state, more powerful than it has ever been. And for the first time in the current century, anyone remembered about Ligor - the little statelet on the Malay peninsula. Realizing their impending doom, the Ligorians asked Bangkok to accept them into the growing kingdom - lest they would meet a most terrible end.;;;;;;;;;;;;
166024DESC;Angkor has fallen to our armies. Now we shall carve up Cambodia as agreed in the treaty of Saigon.;;;;;;;;;;;;

164000TITLE;We are free!;;;;;;;;;;;;
164000DESC;We have finally managed to make ourselves free from our overlords. Whether or not this is a good thing remains to be seen however, as our enemies are still numerous, and without proper protection many question our right to defend ourselves. After all, we are just a small meaningless principality.;;;;;;;;;;;;
164007DESC;With the Indian rebellion finally defeated, it became apparent that our previous methods of colonial administration have not been as effective as we thought. The existance of the Protectorate did not help us administer our territories in India in the slightest, but instead angered the population and provoked a rebellion. As such, the decision has been made to dismantle the Protectorate and incorporate its former territories directly into our state.;;;;;;;;;;;;
164006DESC;The years of anti-colonial struggle of the Indian people have finally paid off - the hated Celts, who occupied the Bengal region since the late 18th century, have finally been kicked out. The colonial administration has been torn down, the bureaucrats killed, and the so-called 'protectorate' dismantled for good. It remains to be seen if the pesky imperialists return, but for now, it is truly a glorious time for the Indian people.;;;;;;;;;;;;
164009DESC;The Indian Subcontinent has experienced a period of unprecedented peace in the last 20 years, with the two great rivals - the Maratha Confedercay and the Sikh Empire - not daring to make the first move. Ever since the betrayal of the Gaekwads in Beroda and their defection to the Sikhs, the balance of powers hasn't shifted, as the Indian states, big and small alike, watched Europeans cement their power on the coast. \nThis peace can't last forever. The Ganges has already been seized in its entirety by the Celts, and the French holdings in the South are rapidly growing. It is time to put an end to the Long Peace of India, and finally settle the century-long rivalry between the two giants.;;;;;;;;;;;;
155000DESC;The Kingdom of Bavaria is, perhaps, the most ambitious state of the last few decades. Upon unexpectedly inheriting the Holy Roman Emperorship in the 1780s after a period dubbed 'The German Renaissance', characterized by a massive increase in national consciousness, Bavaria immediately took up the recently born concept of a German nation-state and began reshaping the old Imperial infrastructure into a more centralised, German-centric form. This did not go with the Empire's borderlands - in particular, with Brabant. Bavarian kings were eventually made to recede their efforts, and, in the wake of republican upheaval of the 1800s, completely abandon the institution of the Holy Roman Empire once and for all. \nBavaria was surely defeated in this confrontation, but it did not lose the struggle as a whole. The last remnants of the defunct Empire in the form of the Zollverein and the German Confederation are still under firm Bavarian control, and the Constantinople Accords awarded Bavaria the much-needed rich lands of Northern Italy. \nThe fate of Germany depends entirely on Bavaria, and the German people await our next moves with bated breath.;;;;;;;;;;;;
155001DESC;Hiding in the shadow of the Kingdom of Bavaria, the disunited lands of Germany are plagued with civil strife, nationalistic upheaval and, most importantly, impatience. \nIn the 1780s, the Holy Roman Emperorship was inherited by the Wittelsbachs of Bavaria, ending the long period of Brabantian rule over the diverse lands. This came as a result of the 'German Renaissance', and it was when the idea of a united Germany took over the people's minds. This idea became the main point of concern of the coming decades, but the dream took a huge hit with the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire after the Fourty Days War. During it, Brabant secured not only its status as a Great Power, but also the heartland of Germany's young industry, the Rhineland. \nGermany lost the battle, but not the war. Soon Bavaria begun the process of rebuilding what was lost, beginning with the foundation of the German Confederation and the re-establishemnt of the late Imperial Diet in the form of the All-German Parliament in Frankfurt. And no matter what now, Germany is not a question of if, but when.;;;;;;;;;;;;
155002DESC;Today, Franz Joseph Ignatz von Fechenbach, the Duke of Franconia, has passed away at the age of 74. He was the first monarch of the re-established Duchy of Franconia, created as a result of the mediatisation of the local princedoms, mainly the Prince-Bishopric of Wurzburg. His brother, Georg Carl, was the last Prince-Bishop of the lands, and his staunch opposition to the annexation of Franconia into the Kingdom of Bavaria led to the 'Fechenbach Compromise' - the last prince's brother was made the first duke of the lands. \nFranz Joseph's eldest son, Friedrich Carl, is now expected to become the second Duke of Franconia. He will take the throne in a few days.;;;;;;;;;;;;
155004DESC;While parading through the streets of Nuremberg, the new Duke of Franconia, Friedrich Carl Joseph von Fechenbach, together with his brother Carl Anton and his wife has been shot dead by a rogue Martletist! While the assasin was immediately torn apart by the crowd, the assasination of three people at once is a complete catastrophe for the Duchy. How the police allowed this to happen is a question for another time, however, as the Duchy is now left without a royal family at all. The Martletist menace that appeared almost out of nowhere is sure to take advantage of this, and we can only hope that they don't try anything even more ambitious.;;;;;;;;;;;;
155006DESC;The unthinkable has occured. Following the assasination of Friedrich Carl of Franconia, the Martletist cells all over the Duchy have risen up in what seems to be a long-planned conspiracy. In the matter of hours, the key institutions of the state have fallen to the rebels, and in the Duchy's place a new state is proclaimed - the Republic of Franconia. The 'government', dubbed the 'Nuremberg Circle' by the press, has called for all Germans to rise and throw their lot at bringing down the monarchies of Germany once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;
155007DESC;The government in Franconia has unexpectedly fallen to our old enemy. It is a surpise for sure, especially considering how close to home such an uprising has occured. Everyone knows what must be done however, and the armies of Bavaria prepare to crush the insurrection as fast as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;
155008DESC;The crisis is over. The short-lived 'Republic' is no more, the city of Nuremberg is placed under martial law and Martletist remnants are being hunted down in the countryside. \nWith the cessation of action on the battlefield come the political consequences of the uprising. The people of Germany are beginning to ask many obvious questions, as to how a conspiracy of such scale has gone unnoticed, whether Bavarian actions were lawful and even what will become of the troublesome Duchy. \nAll of these questions have been answered today, at a special session of the Frankfurt Parliament. Firstly, an investigation into the 'conspiracy' was conducted, and its results say that the uprising was as much of a surprise for the Martletists as it was for the Loyalists - it was a peculiar series of coincidences. Secondly, the Parliament has declared all Martletists to be traitors to the German cause, giving legal justification to all hostile actions taken against them. And thirdly, it has been decided that Franconia is to be mediatised into the Kingdom of Bavaria, - a move expected by many. \nConsequences of a wider scale remain to be seen, as many fear Bavaria's next move.;;;;;;;;;;;;
155009DESC;In an unusual turn of events, the All-German Parliament in Frankfurt convenes for the second time in such a short period. It is once again called by Bavaria, - but this time, it is of much more concern to the international community than the last one, since the Bavarian delegation has presented what they say is a plan to prevent a repeat of the Franconian Crisis. \nThe highly contested vote ended with the acceptance of the proposal, with the Hanseatic delegates abstaining and the Westphalian delegates, being in firm opposition to it, storming out of the Assembly. The Parliament has issued 'The Frankfurt Proclamation of $YEAR$', allowing the Leader of the German Confederation to undertake any actions necessary to ensure the stability of the Confederation, including war. \nWhile a proposal to extend these rights to allow aggressive actions against the members of the Confederation has not been put forward due to fear of a negative response from even Bavaria's closest allies, the neighboring non-members, including Zapadoslavia and Brabant, have been quick to denounce the Proclamation. It seems like war is coming to Europe, and Germania may soon be not a distant dream, but a reality.;;;;;;;;;;;;
155013DESC;As the turn of the century draws ever closer, it becomes increasingly clear that the German Dream has failed miserably. The unification of Germany, once seen as an inevitability, has been successfully thwarted by the neighboring powers. \nYou can destroy Germany polically, but you cannot challenge the will of the German people. Recently, a group of liberal nationalists, with considerable connections in the governments of several other German states, have approached us with a most unexpected offer: proclaim the German Empire in circumvention of all international treaties and rules, achieving the Dream once and for all, though with a possibility of a considerable number of German states refusing our mad dash. They also demand that a new liberal constitution be established in the newly-formed Empire as a form of payment for their services. \nDo we take their offer and face the consequences of such reckless actions, or do we bide our time and bet on our own efforts?;;;;;;;;;;;;
155014DESC;The All-German Parliament in Frankfurt unexpectedly convenes again, possibly for the last time, as we receive most surprising news: the German Empire has been proclaimed. \nA complete shock to all international observers, this event has once again shaken Germany to its core, and it is evident that immediate action is required: we either support the idea of a Unified Germany and join the newly-formed state, of we reject such recklessness and continue to abide by all rules and stipulations of all international treaties that led to this event in the first place. \nPerhaps, we could make our own contribution to the fulfillment of the German Dream...;;;;;;;;;;;;
155015DESC;The German Dream, once though to be crushed for good, has finally been fulfilled! \nIn an unexpected turn of events, a group of highly-influential figures have approached the leader of the strongest German state to proclaim the German Empire in circumvention of all interantional treaties and stipulations. One thing led to another, and now the All-German Parliament in Frankfurt convenes again to bestow the Imperial Crown of a new Germany upon its first Emperor. \nInternational observers are shocked by these happenings, and the Empire's neighbours have been quick to denounce the opportunistic move. \nWhat future holds for a new Germany is a matter of debate, however, as many core German lands ei in the hands of foreign powers. Whether the young Empire can survive or not is a question only time can answer.;;;;;;;;;;;;
155016DESC;In the closing days of the Fourty Days War, we thought that Germania was dead. Beaten by the Brabantians, she lost not only the rich Rhineland, but also its pride and dignity, as the centuries-old institution of the Holy Roman Empire was disestablished. While the Constantinople Accords alleviated the situation a little bit, the future nevertheless seemed bleak, as the newly-born German Confederation was seen by many as an endeavour doomed to fail. \nThey turned out to be wrong. Today, all of Germany erupts in celebrations, as the All-German Parliament declares the Unification of Germany, placing the newly-forged Imperial Crown atop the first Emperor's head. Years of bloodshed, wars and political scheming have finally borne fruit, as a new power is born in Europe, one that is destined to dominate the continent, if not the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;
155017DESC;One of the first questions the new German government has to face is the question of Empire's capital. Currently, the government institutions are divided between two cities, - our former capital and Frankfurt, the seat of the All-German Parliament. \nWhile Frankfurt would be a logical choice, as this city has become the center of all German political life ever since the transformation of the old Imperial Diet into the Parliament, other options are present as well: major cities of Germany are also bustling with life, and, as some say, are much more suited for the title of the Imperial Capital. \nThe choice is ultimately up to us. What should the new capital of Germany be?;;;;;;;;;;;;
155018DESC;With the last independent German state annexed into the Greater German State, the last vestiges of artificial feudal divisions are quick to disappear, the formerly disunited peoples accepting their German identity. It does not matter whether you are from Munich, Frankfurt, Munster or Berlin - you are equally German, and nothing will shake the unity of the German people ever again.;;;;;;;;;;;;
155006TITLE;The Nuremberg Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;
167000DESC;The Cape Colony, also known as Kaapland, owes its existence to the United East India Company, now an independent entity that rules the local Boer population with an iron fist. Being extorted for all they had during the East Indies War, when a coalition of European powers descended upon the increasingly mercantile and powerful Company, the Boers attempted to establish a Republic of their own. At first, their efforts bore fruit, as the Danish forces had occupied the colony. But it soon became apparent that the Danish had no interest in such projects, and instead the colony was set to be occupied for an undefined amount of time. And as the fires of the revolution engulfed Sweden, the Danish were made to withdraw and hand the control of the company back to the Company. \With the Company's administration starting a crackdown campaign, many Boers assemble into their own bands with the goal of venturing further into the African interior, starting what is known as 'The Great Trek'. And in the Cape itself, the tensions are high, as many prepare to leave as well. Disobedience is rampant, as people sense the weakness of the local government, and significant developments elsewhere may end up lighting the spark.;;;;;;;;;;;;
167001DESC;Unsettling news from Europe reach Kaapstad: Franconia has fallen to the revolutionaries. \nBeing Bavaria’s backyard, Franconia was considered one of the least likely regions where the Martletists would once again appear. With this knowledge, the population of Kaapstad felt empowered to start organising an uprising of their own, taking inspiration from their German cousins in Nuremberg. An increased amount of bombings, political murders and other terrorist acts have been reported as of recently, and with the local garrison almost overwhelmed, it seems like the situation is at a breaking point. \nMessangers have been sent to the city of Batavia, however, it will take them a long time to traverse the Indian Ocean.;;;;;;;;;;;;
167002DESC;The shockwave sent by the recent happenings in Germany has reached farther than anyone has anticipated, as the long-oppressed population of Kaapstad revolts against the VOC. Having already attempted to establish a Republic of their own during the Danish occupation of the colony that ended a few years prior, the local Dutch-speaking population began organising into bands with the goal of venturing into the African interior, starting what became known as the ‘Great Trek’. Inspired by their German cousins, in the last few days the heavily militarized Afrikaner population has begun storming colonial offices of the Company, mercilessly slaughtering its officials and bureaucrats. \nA new flag is now seen atop the buildings of Kaapstad, and an establishment of a new state on the Southern tip of Africa may attract attention of the colonial powers, eager to exploit the untapped resources of the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;
167003DESC;Terrible news reach us from Kaapstad: our colony there is no more. The local Boer population, inspired by the Franconian uprising, has seized control over the region, finally acomplishing their goal of independence. Whatever loyalists that survived the massacres have arrived in our capital, some of them immediately petitoning the Board to send an army to quell the uprising. We, however, know better: traversing the Indian Ocean is no easy task, and considering how many of these 'survivors' perished during the trip, we are definitely not spending our valuable resorces to retake that land.;;;;;;;;;;;;
167004DESC;In the early days of the Cape Colony, the driving force of its territorial expansion were the Trekboers, nomadic pastoralists who ventured deeper into the African interior and founded settlements there. While some Trekboers settled and became farmers, others continued further into the Great Karoo desert, many joining the Voortrekkers fleeing the Company’s persecution. \nNews of Kaapland’s independence have been met with joy among their ranks. While their economic independence is not to be touched, they are more than happy to help us incorporate the borderlands, further securing us from cattle raids of the negroes and granting us an official border in the north.;;;;;;;;;;;;
167005DESC;The Xhosa, a large tribe on our Eastern border, are known across the lands as the most dangerous and the most hated group of native peoples in the region. They have been conducting cattle raids on our lands ever since we first came into contact with them, and the little resources the Company could spare on us were not enough to prevent them from eventually pushing us out of Graaff-Reinet. Many of our brothers still reside in these lands, hunting and being hunted by the Xhosa, with many also fleeing to the Western Cape. Some influential men in our newly-established government, such as Andries Pretorius, are also refugees from the area. And with the issue of government settled, we may begin an expedition to punish the Xhosa and push them back behind the Great Kei. \n§REnforcing the Cut Down to Size CB will return us our cores.;;;;;;;;;;;;
167006DESC;We have managed to push the Xhosa tribesmen out of our rightful lands in the Eastern Cape. Celebrations erupt in our major cities, while many local Afrikaners thank us for our efforts. \nThere is a different side to this occasion, however. Our people hold grievances against the negroes, and those who possess the means to carry out mass killings do it with great joy. While we are not against it (it means more land for settlement), the International community will definitely not take it lightly.;;;;;;;;;;;;
167007DESC;As the dust settles after our successful uprising, we find ourselves in a desperate need of an actual government. Our attempted establishment of the Republic in 1832 gave us several important lessons about governance, and several ambitious men have already begun working on convening the Volksraad, our new parliament. It will then adopt a proper constitution and establish the presidential office. In the meantime, many have agreed that the ambitious Andries Pretorius, a fifth-generation Afrikaner from Graaff-Reinet, forced out of the area by the Xhosa, must become an interim governor. \nWe are also met with a need for a proper flag for our nation. When Kaapstad was liberated, the flag that was hoisted atop most government buildings was the 'Kruisvlag', a red saltire outlined in white on a dark blue field. While historically significant, it is also quite rudimentary, and many people feel like it does not properly represent our state. As such, the 'Vierkleur' has been proposed - it is the old flag of the Dutch Republic with a green line attached to the left. While simple, it has already managed to gather some popularity, and a large part of our population has already begun using it.;;;;;;;;;;;;
167009DESC;As time goes on, we get more and more reports of our Voortrekker brothers' adventures in the interior. While not a lot of them managed to depart in time before the Cape Agency got overthrown, they were still able to cause chaos among the Sotho and Nguni tribes, scoring major victories while being severely outnumbered. One of such groups, led by Hendrik Potgieter, now moved into the area they call Transvaal after being forced out of the Zulu lands. There they are planning to settle and establish a republic of their own, but they are unlikely to succeed without our help. \nOur state is young and is still relatively weak, but many are saying that we must go east and annex the local tribes, as they have been weakened by the period of unrest and devastation known as 'Mfecane'. In the meanwhile, many trekkers will return to our lands, and those who stay will fortify their positions and await our arrival.;;;;;;;;;;;
167010DESC;Europe is once again engulfed in rebellion, as Martletists and other groups rise up in their bid for whatever their political agenda is. And while Kaapland is situaated at a comfortable distance from these events, the population can't help but notice that there haven't been any major political reform since the establishment of the Republic. While undoubtedly still more progressive than whatever most nations of the world have, our voting system heavily favors the wealthiest members of our society. It is not a pressing issue, but with the onset of a new period of political instability, some are starting to say that this is an opportunity: we may attract the much-needed immigrants. Settlement of the barren lands of South Africa will surely make us a formidable force on the international arena.;;;;;;;;;;;;
167011DESC;After successful settlement of the closer areas of the Karoo desert, the Trekboers now venture further north, encoutering the Nama tribes in the local deserts. While entirely unsuited for farming, these lands are wast and to some extent valuable as pastoral lands. For now we have no means of actually controlling the land, but the local Trekboers will give us a solid claim to the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;
168000DESC;The Saudi court lies in shambles. News of defeat in the latest wars have caused a great upheaval across the country, leading to many of our subjects losing faith in the teachings of al-Wahhabi. Already, revolts have sprung up across the countryside, as tribes renounce their allegiance to the Wahhabi cause. Amidst the chaos, the ruling House of Saud has removed the major Wahhabi leaders from positions of power and taken over the government in its entirety. The capital was swiftly moved from Diriyah to the neighbouring city of Riyadh, in a bid to found a new state.;;;;;;;;;;;;
168001DESC;The Omani Empire has long been an emeny of the Emirate of Diriyah, the two fighting for dominance in the Arabian Peninsula but never managing to fully crush the enemy. Now, it seems like the Omani power is at an all-time low, and it would be a perfect opportunity to finish our unification of Arabia. With the soldiers' morale being at an all-time high, victory is all but assured.;;;;;;;;;;;;
150000DESC;Espania is very diverse linguistically, featuring a multitude of small dialects and sometimes hardly outlineable languages. Years spent in forceful isolation from their kin have made the speakers of Iberian Romance develop unique and highly diverse linguistical features, and despite stemming from the same root, the differences make outlining the languages very difficult. In fact, you cannot tell where one language ends and another begins, as, depending on the dialect, it can be at the same time both mutually intelligible and completely incomprehensible for the inhabitants of two neighboring villages. \nSuch incredible diversity may be fascinating from a linguistical standpoint, but on a government level it creates a multitude of problems. The standard dialect of all government documents is the Palenciano variety of the Castilian language, understood by the Castilians and incomprehensible for the Aragonese. Thus, it is required to translate the orders into a multitude of dialects. \nThe strain put on the government apparatus will have to be solved with a language reform. One that the minorities will, most certainly, not like.;;;;;;;;;;;;
150001DESC;The last century has not been kind to Al-Andalus. Following a catastrophic defeat during the Great Peninsular War, a culmination of a centuries-long conflict between the Christians and the Muslims of Iberia, the Andalusian state was forced into a deep economic crisis, which was to be solved with war. Bitter about its loss in the north, Al-Andalus turned to the south, where lay its old friend-turned-enemy, the Mali Empire. In a bid to seize the Malian colonies, the Sultanate became embroiled in a long and exhausting war, and while it may have ended with an Andalusian victory and a complete disintegration of the Mali Empire, the costs were too high to cover. Then came the exploitation of the colonies, then a revolt - one that Al-Andalus had no chance against. \nNow, after several decades of absence from European politics, it is time to make a return. Nobody knows what this entails, as the newly-born 'Espania' is backed by a resurgent French state - without allies, victory is improbable. Confusion reins in Cordoba, as future seems very bleak.;;;;;;;;;;;;
150002DESC;Our recent loss of territory in Morocco has not gone unnoticed by the Berber tribes of the Sahara. With our borders now not allowing a good connection to the region, a significant amount of desert tribesmen have seized control of it. For now, we have no choice but to accept the situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;
150004DESC;The Duchy of Barcelona, ruled by a dynasty with the same name, was the subject of the Occitan Kingdom for more than half of a millenium. They have enjoyed great political freedoms, rarely contributing to wars of their liege and instead focusing on ensuring the prosperity of the realm. Quite popular among the Catalan people, they nevertheless were overthrown in 1821 in a bloody revolution, when the majority of the Barcelona Dynasty was massacred. Back then, all countries involved with Catalonia - France, Espania and Andalusia - decided against intervention, for all countries were exhausted from war and did not want to light the spark that could result in a devastating war in Iberia. Now, however, the Moorish borders have been pushed far enough south to allow us to take action against the Republic. \nTwo options are presented to us. We can either support the various monarchists who wish for the Barcelona Dynasty to be restored; giving them funding and troops will ensure a swift coup, giving us a loyal vassal. Or, we could simply invade the Republic and incorporate it directly into Espania, for such a measure will have yo be done at some point no matter our choice now.;;;;;;;;;;;;
150006DESC;With the loss of key urban centers in Al-Andalus, the government has no choice but to relocate to Morocco. There, a new state will have to be built, and it remains to be seen if the Exiles will return or if the ancient Al-Andalus has been lost for good.;;;;;;;;;;;;
150007DESC;A little more than 20 years have passed ever since we have started the Language Reform, and it is time to assess the results. \nWithout a doubt, the Reform has been a success. We have standardized the Castilian language and taught it to the populace of Iberia, so that the Espanian peoples may all speak a uniform language. And while some stubborn conservatives still resist our efforts, they are an absolute minority. \nThe valuable expertise that we gained during the Reform will surely help us with our education efforts in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;
156000DESC;The Kingdom of Brabant, as it has been known since 1764, is one of the last remnants of the old Holy Roman feudalism on the map of Europe. Rising as a duchy in the Lowlands, the polity's rulers secured themselves the Imperial Crown for more than two hundred years. Wittelsbachs' ascension to Emperorship and the German Renaissance of the 1780s placed Brabant in firm opposition to the Empire, as it became more German-centric and centralised. \nBavarian centralisation efforts culminated in the Forty Days War, in which a coalition consisting of Brabant, Bohemia (and their Polish crownlands) and a number of North German statelets overwhelmed the Loyalists and forced Bavaria to abandon their plans. Brabant came out of this war as a Great Power, securing itself the heartland of Germany's young industry, the Rhineland. The following Martletist Wars yielded Brabant the 'Southeastern cession' in England, while Friesland and Westphalia pleaded for protection from Bavarian ambitions. \nSuch an expansive empire cannot be run on old feudal principles. The times are changing, and so do the methods of governance. Our state will have to find a basis in the form of a national identity, lest it collapses in a fiery mess.;;;;;;;;;;;;
157000DESC;The Peace of Caerlleon, signed in 1822 by Daneland and the Celtic Union, is an agreement that aims to establish long-lasting peace and cooperation on the British Isles after the calamitous events of the first quarter of the century. The agreement itself consists of a non-aggression pact, a customs union as well as a promise to not intervene in each other's internal affairs, especially in regard to the English question. \nSeemingly fragile, Caerlleon offers a multitude of benefits to both sides, which means that breaking it would jeopardize the heavily intertwined economies of the two states. Thus, the sides are encouraged to look beyond their home region and to project their growing influence across the world. \nAs it stands now, things seem to be going great in the British Isles. The English Martlet has been subdued, with the Free City of Lundenburg the only remaining stronghold of questionable thought. Daneland has fully stabilized the countryside and has already surpassed the pre-Martlet production levels. And the Celtic Union has laid the foundations of its new capital in Llynlleifiad. It remains to be seen if this calm is to last.;;;;;;;;;;;;
157001TITLE;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Breaks the Peace of Caerlleon!;;;;;;;;;;;;
157001DESC;We have received a notice from our neighbours that they declare the Treaty of Caerlleon null and void, and will no longer abide by the stipulations. It will bring not only severe economic consequences, but an ever-present threat of war on the isles, as we are no longer bound by any obligations.;;;;;;;;;;;;
157002DESC;Our allies in Jorvik have recently sent us a peculiar request: they want our colony of New Sjaelland. While the request in undoubtedly bold, the faraway venture has little popular support, as it is largely seen to be more trouble than it's worth. Continuing attacks by the natives, lack of natural resources and the distance to the colony make it quite useless indeed. Perhaps giving it to our allies would be a more benificial use our failed venture.;;;;;;;;;;;;
157003DESC;The Danish have accepted our request, and now we have acquired our first proper colony!;;;;;;;;;;;;
157004DESC;The Danish have refused to give us New Sjaelland, saying that they may find it useful later. It somes as a major blow to our relations, as this response was completely unexpected.;;;;;;;;;;;;
157005DESC;The Celtic Union has lost its lands on the isle of Prydain. With Alba and Cymru having slipped out of the government's control, the dream of a unified Celtic state is finally laid to rest. The Celtic Union is no more - with only Eire left standing.;;;;;;;;;;;;
157006DESC;Yesterday morning, what started as an attempt to arrest a Martletist agitator in a village in Mercia has spiralled out of control, as the local populace had taken up arms in defence of the criminal. The news of the event quickly spread though the countryside, with many other villages joining the cause. And in the cities, the Martletist underground was quick to sign the beginning of a revolt that has been in the works for two decades. \nThus began the Second Martlet Revolt, the English people's second attempt at gaining the freedom that was taken from them centuries ago. It remains to be seen what the international response is going to be, or if a repeat of the Martletist Wars is in sight.;;;;;;;;;;;;
157007DESC;The Free City of Lundenburg has fallen to a coup led by our supporters. They have quickly sworn allegiance to the Martletist cause, giving us the valuable city.;;;;;;;;;;;;
157008DESC;In 1798, the British Isles were shaken by what would later be called the Martlet Revolt. The Anglo-Saxon masses, oppressed for centuries and marginalised by the Industrial Revolution, have risen up across Daneland, their numbers quickly overwhelming Danish military. Little did Europe know, that this revolt would be the start of a series of horrible wars all over the continent, as problems that were swept under the rug were resurfacing. \nEventually, the revolters were crushed under the combined might of Europe's most powerful militaries. Denmark would not, however, make a return to the isles: a new state was to be created out of the Danish holdings in England - Daneland. A compromise aimed to please the Anglo-Saxons, it was supposed to bring long-lasting peace to these troubled lands. \nAlas, it was not meant to be. The number of reports of small-scale civil unrest and disobedience is growing each coming month, and an increase in underground operations of some sort is noticed by everyone. Something is clearly afoot in England, and we must prepare to face it. \n§RIf we do not annex Lundenburg by 1847, we will face an English revolt!;;;;;;;;;;;;

152000DESC;Russia, 'the Giant of the East', is considered by many a peculiar case of a stubbornly conservative country, both its population and its government clinging onto many relics of the past. It is as much of a peculiarity as it is an enigma, as many ask the question of how, in spite of a severe lack of reforms and, arguably, complete disconnection from reality, the Russian state institutions have allowed the country to successfully counter the many attempts by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, supported by its Bohemian ally, to restore its lost eastern holdings. \nAnd while many say that these same institutions are Russia's saviour here, as time has carefully shaped them according to Russia's needs, it would be unwise to deny their sorry state. Disobedience is rampant, the state seemingly exists only to serve the needs of the nobility, the originally advisory Sobor in becoming more and more independent with each passing day, all the while peasants toil the lands, suffering under the nobles’ watchful eyes. \nRussia's only chance to survive is the thing it hates the most - reform. What kind is a question to be discussed.;;;;;;;;;;;;
160000DESC;We are not alone in our current war against Constantinople: there are also the Egyptians, who had refused to follow the terms of a treaty they signed with the Byzantines and give up Cilicia. Their army is weak, being a crude mix of old Ethiopian military organisation and traditional Berber clan systems. We could potentially send a few of our advisors to Alexandria in an effort to help them modernise their army, and also potentially several ships filled with military equipment. Shall we do it?;;;;;;;;;;;;
160001DESC;Strange reports are coming from Alexandria's ports: apparently, several Russian cargo ships loaded to the brim with various sorts of armaments and modern military equipment have managed to slip through the Byzantine blockade and arrive safely at our shores. The crews claim that this fleet was sent to us directly by the Russian Tsar, and that they'd like to help our military modernise. The reason for such generosity is our war against Byzantium - and surely, the amount of guns they've brought with them will help us greatly in our fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;

The crews claim that this fleet was sent to us directly by the Russian Tsar, and that they'd like to help our military modernise. \nWe do not know how many months these ships spent at sea, but it was obvious that they were not familiar with the news. \nThe war has ended. \nOur guests were certainly not pleased to hear this. Not only did it mean that their safe passage to Alexandira wasn't much of a miracle, but also that these armaments were entirely useless to us. Orders were orders however, so we took the arms as if it was currently wartime and employed the advisors' help.;;;;;;;;;;;;
160003DESC;Moscow and Constantinople are not known for having the best of relationships, as the two sides have been feuding over the issue of borders and religion for well over three centuries. The rivalry began with the decision of the Muscovite princes to support the Paleologoi during the period of dynastic unrest in Byzantium in the late 15th century, and later escalated, as the two sides found themselves divided not only by their vision of the future of the Pontic Steppe, but also by religion: the 17th century brought a schism in the Eastern Orthodoxy, as the unrecognized Partiarch of Moscow and All Russia Nikon officially broke with Constantinople. \nIn the following decades (and even centuries), the mutual hatred worsened, and now the two countries find themselves in a standoff over the Byzantine colony of Crimea. But despite the seemingly inevitable prospect of war, diplomacy may still solve the crisis - but only if both the Tsar and the Basileus are willing to concede their pride. \n§RIf diplomacy fails, war is inevitable!;;;;;;;;;;;;
160005DESC;While we are gearing up for war, there may still be a diplomatic slution somewhere. While the Byzantine Empire enjoys the diplomatic free-handedness, Russia is isolated - to our north lie the vengeant Swedes, to our west lie our permanent enemies, the Bohemians, the Poles and the Lithuanians, to the east lie endless wastes (and a hostile California), and passing on the possibility of convincing the south, which shares many of our values (both the Orthodox faith and a lack of overlapping interests - besides Crima, of course), would be extremely unwise. Perhaps, we could try to send the finest of our men to Constantinople - surely the Greeks are not stupid enough to fight a war they are bound to lose?;;;;;;;;;;;;
160006DESC;Constantinople is the greatest city of Europe, and no guest would be a particular surprise to see in the City of Cities. We were, however, very surprised to learn that a diplomatic mission from Moscow has requested audience with the Basileus. And the reason they come with is even more curious: apparently, the Russian Tsar is willing to swallow his pride and had ordered his men to try to convince us to give up our lands on the northern coast of the Black Sea in exchange for an alliance. With our nations being close to a state of war, this proposal is unexpected - but it is deefinitely worthy of consideration. \nUpon hearing the news of the Russian arrival, our Mesazon Metaxas was jubilant, immediately advising the Basileus to accept the offer, with the argument being that a strong ally in the east would be worth more than Crimea and a gruesome war. His enemies, the Hellenophiles, think different: to them the idea of giving up Crimea is treasonous in itself, and as such they are saying that we must turn down the Russian proposal. In the end, the choice is up to the Basileus.;;;;;;;;;;;;
160007DESC;The Greeks have outright rejected our proposal and have sent our diplomats away. It seems like diplomacy has failed.;;;;;;;;;;;;
160008DESC;Today we have received news from Constantinople that, in an unexpected turn of events, our offer was accepted! The Greeks will transfer us the ownership of Crimea, and we will establish an alliance between our two nations. This is a great day for Russia, for the diplomatic isolation is now over!;;;;;;;;;;;;
160009DESC;Tensions between Moscow and Constantinople have finally boiled over, as the two sides have failed to find a diplomatic solution to the issue of Crimea which has plagued the Russo-Byzantine relations for more than two centuries. Now the differences will have to be settled on the battlefield.;;;;;;;;;;;;
160011DESC;In an outcome we did not expect, the Russian arms have not triumphed in Crimea. We have been beaten and defeated, and are now forced to sign a humiliating peace with the Greeks.;;;;;;;;;;;;
160012DESC;The Russians and the Byzantines have gone to war once again. Due to reasons yet unknown, the diplomatic endeavours between the two sides have failed miserably, but what matters for Zapadoslavia is the fact that we might finally be able to convince Constantinople to sign an official alliance. Together, we shall finally crush Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;;
160013DESC;The Crimean War has come to its conclusion: and despite us initially being on the backfoot, the Empire has once again come out on top! We have bested the invading Russian armies and expelled them from our holdings and beyond. Celebrations have erupted across the Empire, but one of the few who are not celebrating is Metaxas. He is saying that, no matter what, reconquering the west while trying to defend the east is going to result in a resounding defeat for the Empire. But the Hellenophiles raise a valid question: is the west worth is?;;;;;;;;;;;;
160014DESC;It seems like neither side has managed to secure proper victory in the Crimean War. The Byzantine Empire has not completed its goal of kicking Russia out of the Azov Sea, and Russia has not taken Crimea. Nevertheless, since the Empire was on the defence, it is technically a victory for Constantinople. It remains to be seen whether the sides will come to an agreement now.;;;;;;;;;;;;
160015DESC;As expected, the Russian armies have overwhelmed the Greek defences and pushed them out of Crimea, finally putting a decisive end to the Byzantine presence in the Pontic Steppe region.;;;;;;;;;;;;
160017DESC;It seems like in the end, Metaxas was right. The Imperial armies have been bested by the Russians, losing the territories on the northern coast of the Black Sea. It seems like all Imperial influence in the Pontic Steppe is lost, and we do not know if we are going to be able to make a return.;;;;;;;;;;;;

160021DESC;Today we have received news from Constantinople that, in an unexpected turn of events, our offer was well-received by the Greek court, but instead of outright accepting our terms, the Basileus decided to offer terms of his own. According to them, the Byzantines are willing to part with Crimea and all other lands we have laid claim to, but in exchange the Patriarchate of Moscow shall give up its autonomy and be demoted into a Metropolitan, in a subservient poisiton to the Constantinople Patriarchate. While it is a bold offer, Russia finds itself in such a situation that it must think pragmatically. Ending the autocephaly of our Church will come as a blow to our prestige, as well as grant the Greeks a final say in all religious matters in Russia. But accepting this offer would end the diplomatic isolation of Russia, - and, as an adiition, it will finally put an end to the Nikonite Schism. Shall we accept the Greek proposal?;;;;;;;;;;;;
160022DESC;The Russians have accepted our counteroffer! In exchange for the lands they claim, the Patriarchate of Moscow and All Russia shall renounce its autocephaly, thus being demoted back to a Metropolitan. This brings and end to the Nikonite Schism of the Eatern Orthodox Church, and we can proudly say that our side won. While the public opinion is on our side in saying that giving up Crimea was certainly worth solving the Schism, the Hellenophiles are in shambles, as their hated enemy is now an ally of the Empire. They have, however, been given a second chance by the Basileus.;;;;;;;;;;;;
160023DESC;The Russians have rejected our counteroffer. We offered them the lands they claim in exchange for the Patriarchate of Moscow and All Russia renouncing its autocephaly and being demoted back to a Metropolitan, and, as expected, this turned out to be too much for the Russians, as it would give Constantinople the final say in all religious affairs inside of Russia. It seems like war is inevitable now.;;;;;;;;;;;;
160024DESC;With the cessation of hostilities, the Byzantine Empire is forced to look for a new strategy in the Black Sea. Despite their pride, the Greeks know that with their lands in Crimea lost, there is little chance that they are going to be able to reclaim what they've lost. Even though it had to come to war, perhaps the power of diplomacy is not yet completely exhausted, as Constantinople may still be willing to part with their claims on Crimea and sign an alliance with us. Shall we send a delegation with an offer of reconciliation?;;;;;;;;;;;;
160025DESC;With the cessation of hostilities, the Empire is forced to look for a new strategy in the Black Sea. Despite our strength, we know that with our lands in Crimea lost, there is little chance that we are going to be able to reclaim what we've lost. It seems like this is what the Russian delegation which recently arrived at Constantinople had in mind when they peresented us with an offer of reconciliation: they propose an alliance in exchange for us renouncing the claim of Crimea and all of the land we've lost.  Even though it had to come to war, perhaps the power of diplomacy is not yet completely exhausted - shall we accept the Russian offer? \n§RIf we accept, we will transfer all Russian cores we own (if any) to Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;;
160026DESC;The Greeks have accepted our offer of reconciliation, and now we shall enter an alliance, while Constantinople will drop all claims on our lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;
160027DESC;The Greeks have declined our offer or reconciliation. They say you can hear any language in Constantinople, but the Basileus truly understands only one: force of arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;
160028DESC;With the cessation of hostilities, both us and the Greeks are forced to look for a new strategy in the Black Sea. While we have not managed to secure Crimea, we took the Circassian coastline, lands that are worth little for Constantinople, but a lot for us, since they grant us access to the Black Sea. Perhaps we could try one last thing to break our diplomatic isolation: we may offer the Greeks a mutual renouncement of claims and an alliance. Shall we send a delegation to Constantinople with an offer of reconciliation? \n§RIf the treaty is signed, we will abandon claims on Crimea, while the Byzantines will abandon claims on any lands we own.;;;;;;;;;;;;

160032DESC;Terrible news from Constantinople: the Russians and the Greeks have agreed on a peaceful resolution to the Crimean issue, and have signed an alliance to top it off. This is a disaster for Zapadoslav foreign policy, as we have tried to convince Constantinople to coordinate our moves against Russia for the longest time. Now they have not only declined our overtues for the final times, but have signed an alliance with our greatest enemy. We have to seek other allies now.;;;;;;;;;;;;
151000DESC;The Roman Empire, known by many names across Europe, is the oldest continuously surviving state on Earth. Despite many calamities that the Empire has endured during its history, every time the wise men at Constantinople managed to not only save the realm, but also expand it and make it stronger. \nThese wise men have been hailing from the Komnenos dynasty ever since the glorious defeat of the Latin armies by Alexios II Komnenos during the Fourth Crusade. Ever since then, the Imperial bureaucracy has been reformed, the pretenders have been dealt with, the immediate external threats have been crushed and, most importantly, the Empire finally reconciled with its Greek nature, accepting the reality. \nHowever, the times are changing. Rome’s role as the mediator and, arguably, undeserved victor of the Martletist Wars made the Greeks look inwards, towards the great vacuum of ideas that has been left as the result of the Constantinople Accords redrawing Europe to the Empire’s liking. The people looked to the past, but the same past gave different ideas to different men.;;;;;;;;;;;;
151001DESC;Cilicia was a territory of little interest to the Empire for centuries, ever since Ethiopia took over the area in the 16th century. Though the matter of the Orthodox Church in Cilicia and many Anatolian Greeks continuing to settle in these lands made it one of the main points of contention between two Christian Empires, Cilicia was nevertheless discarded until the middle of the 18th century, when Ethiopia fell under its own (and Nader Shah's) weight and the region came under Imperial rule.\nWith the Martletist Wars beginning Europe just a few decades later, the local Armenian population attempted to stage an uprising with a goal to secede to the neighboring Egypt, which was seen as a better alternative to the Empire due to its religious freedoms. One thing led to another, and though the uprising failed due to Egypt's unwillingness to anger Constantinople, it was agreed that the region was to be under Egyptian jurisdiction until things would calm down, and then returned to the Empire. The date agreed on was January 1836, and it has finally come - it's time for Cilicia to return.;;;;;;;;;;;;

151003DESC;As agreed, Egypt has transfered us control over Cilicia. Reintegration efforts have already began.;;;;;;;;;;;;
151004DESC;In a move that clearly contrasts with Egypt's history of diplomacy with us, our request to return Cilicia under Imperial rule was denied. Egypt has cited the fact that 'tensions have clearly not calmed down enough', and no new date for the return was specified, meaning that Cilicia was to remain under Egyptian rule pretty much indefinitely. We will not allow this to stand, Cilicia will be reclaimed by force!;;;;;;;;;;;;
151005DESC;Egypt has won! Despite being outnumbered and outgunned, Egypt was seemingly not outwitted, as Cilicia was succesfully defended. Constantinople was forced to the negotiating table and here they abandoned their claims on the region. This is a great victory for us!;;;;;;;;;;;;
151006DESC;As expected, Egypt stood no chance against Constantinople. Our armies were defeated and routed from Cilicia, and we were forced to surrender the region. This is a great humiliation for us.;;;;;;;;;;;;
151007DESC;The internal politics of the Empire have since then been dictated by a question thought to be answered long ago: is the Empire Greek or Roman? The current Mesazon (what the Westerners would call a PM), Andreas Metaxas, is supporting the idea of complete reconciliation between these two ideas and subsequent territorial expansion in the west. His rivals, a group of reactionary populists called the Hellenophiles, are arguing for a complete purge of all Latin legacy and a full embracement of the Empire’s Greek nature. While their rhetoric is undoubtedly aggressive and dangerous, they enjoy considerable support from much of the peasantry. \nThe final say in this debate is, of course, with the Basileus, Andronikos III. He is old and ailing, but he may still crush one side or another if any of them takes a wrong step. The Empire’s future depends on whoever wins the Emperor’s favor. \n\n§RYou will receive notifications each time influence changes.;;;;;;;;;;;;
151008DESC;Another pressing issue is the matter of the Bulgarian peoples in their corresponding theme. Despite firnly being under the rule of Constantinople for almost half a millenium, the local populace hasn't forgotten the 'glory' of their long-fallen empires, and despite the successful hellenization of a significant part of their country, many among the Imperial court say that they could potentially pose an even more significant threat than their northern counterparts. \nAs per usual, the views on the future of the Bulgars differ. Metaxas proposes to continue the policy of hellenization and destroy any idea of an independent Bulgaria, even at a cost of angering the populace. The Hellenophiles offer a radically different solution: recognize the Bulgarians as equals and fully integrate them into the Imperial bureaucracy. \nIt remains to be seen what comes of the Bulgarians.;;;;;;;;;;;;
151009DESC;empty;;;;;;;;;;;;
151010DESC;Today, Basileus Andronikos III passed away peacefully in his sleep at the age of 78. He is regarded as one of the greatest Byzantine Emperors, managing to not only effectively channel the Empire's potential towards victory in the Martletist Wars, but also securing a favourable peace settlement in the Constantinople Accords after the War.\nDespite earlier successes, in his later years the Basileus had grown week in both body and mind, and the last decade of his rule was characterized by an intense internal struggle between Mesazon Andreas Metaxas and a group calling themselves the Hellenophiles. In the end, the latter were unable to gain enough influence before the death of the Emperor, and the Heir, Anastasius, a vivid supporter of Metaxas's ideas, is sure to crush the group's ambitions. A new era begins in the Byzantine Empire's history - and many fear that the Old Order may not be so respected in it.;;;;;;;;;;;;
151011DESC;Following many defeats the Hellenophiles have faced in the Empire's internal politics, coupled with their ideas on external politics being crushed by harsh reality, their influence has fallen to a level where the group's fate is pretty much sealed. Government figures initially loyal to them have began switching sides already, and, with popular support falling rapidly, any internal cohesion the Hellenophiles might have had is now virtually non-existent. Some of the key figures of the movement have fled to neighboring countries fearing judgement either by the government or by the mob, while others have gone into hiding. All of this can only mean one thing - the Mesazon has won, and his vision of the Empire's future is now unrivalled in the government.;;;;;;;;;;;;
151012DESC;Though the days when the Basileus could be easily influenced by court factions are long gone, it seems like sometimes, old habits are bound to surface again, as the decried Mesazon Andreas Metaxas has been dismissed by Andronikos III.\nThis wasn't just a simple dismission - in reality, it is not a secret that the Emperor trusted his second-in-command and viewed the ideas of his main adversaries, the Hellenophiles, as questionable at best. But many failures of the Mesazon over the past years, the complete control of the Hellenophiles over the Senate and at least a partial implementation of their views on foreign policy made Metaxas much more of a liability for the State. As such, he was sent into retirement - and despite the priviliges the Emperor assigned to him, and the giant pension, he cannot help but weep as he sees the upstarts start tearing his beloved Empire apart.;;;;;;;;;;;
151013DESC;The Nish Rebellion was a Bulgarian and Serbian popular uprising in the Theme of Bulgaria which began after the local religious authorities decided do disregard the right of Slavic lands to conduct the Divine Liturgy in Church Slavonic, and not in Greek. It was rapid, large and forceful, relatively unexpected by Constantinople with initial combat successes. It is a direct continuation of the previous demands to give South Slavs more autonomy, though the rebels currently only demand improving the tax system and other small concessions. While the Senate is split on what should be done about the uprising, the Mesazon has called for the rebellion to be crushed, and the Hellenophiles took the opposite position and are proposing to attempt to negotiate with the rebels. The final say is, of course, up to the Emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;
151014DESC;During the debate concerning the delineation of the borders in Europe following the Martletist Wars, we made sure to cut the Hungarian state down to size and give some Hungarian majority areas to the newly-formed Transylvania. However, it seems like our plans to keep the nations of the Danube disunited failed, as some ambitious individuals in Rumania proposed a bold idea of uniting the cornered nations into a single Carpathia. A conference has been called in Szeged in an attempt to bring this idea to life, and though it is yet uncertain if it could succeed, the prospect of a united Carpathia poses a significant threat to the Empire. Though unfortunately, our options are very limited: the conference itself is no cause for a direct intervention, and the most we could do is express protest.;;;;;;;;;;;;
151015DESC;Georgios Fourtouniadis was elected Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople on 27 September 1835 as Gregorios VI. The new patriarch was characterized by a deep zeal for the Church and austerity in his customs - but also by an unforgivable inflexibility in his own ideas. He published canonical provisions concerning marriages, the education of monks and dogmatic differences with the Catholic Church and the Protestants, he forbid burial inside churches and he condemned the translation of the Bible in a simpler form of the Greek language.\nThe increasing appearance of Catholic and Protestant missionaries in the eastern Mediterranean following the end of the Martletist Wars was particularly distressing to Patriarch Gregory VI, and in 1839, these tensions came to a head when the Patriarch got into a verbal argument with a Papal Nuncio. In response, the Bavarian ambassador, Egid von Kobell, bluntly demanded the removal of Gregory VI and threatened to leave Constantinople over the matter. Wasting no time, Metaxas gave his support to the Patriarch, while the Hellenophiles claim that peace with the West is of utmost importance to the Empire. Do we support the Patriarch or force him to resign?;;;;;;;;;;;;
151016DESC;Today, Basileus Andronikos III passed away peacefully in his sleep at the age of 78. He was regarded as one of the greatest Byzantine Emperors, managing to not only effectively channel the Empire's potential towards victory in the Martletist Wars, but also securing a favourable peace settlement in the Constantinople Accords after the War.\nDespite earlier successes, in his later years the Basileus had grown week in both body and mind, and the last decade of his rule was characterized by an intense internal struggle between Mesazon Andreas Metaxas and a group calling themselves the Hellenophiles. In the end, despite the latter Emperor's sympathies towards Metaxas, the Hellenophiles have succeeded in whqat practically is a legal coup. However, it was not enough to secure their position, as the supposed Heir, Anastasius, is vivid supporter of Metaxas's ideas, and he would surely crush the group's ambitions if he took power. As such, when the Emperor passed away, the Hellenophiles started a real coup - armed men wasted no time in arresting Anastasius and forcing him the not-yet-crowned Emperor to abdicate in favor of his much weaker willed brother Constantine.;;;;;;;;;;;;
151017DESC;When Basileus Andronikos III died, the Hellenophiles have already practically completed a legal coup, stuffing the government with their loyalists. Faced with a threat of the heir apparent Anastasius completely reversing their gains, a real coup was launched, and Anastasius was made to abdicate in favor of his brother Constantine, who was much more accepting of the group's ideas. And thus, for the first time in history, a coronation of an Emperor of a completely different Empire was held in Constantinople - to the surprise of many, the Hellenophiles were very serious about their ideas, and Constantine XV was crowned not as an Emperor of the Romans, but as an Emperor of the Greeks.\nWith this historic moment, the thousands year long Empire is gone - and in its place now stands the Hellenic Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;
151018DESC;With the death of Emperor Andronikos III, who is regarded as one of the greatest Byzantine Emperors, the internal power struggle within the Empire between the Hellenophiles and Metaxas comes to an end. The new Emperor, Anastasius III, has completely ousted all remnants of Hellenophile influence in the government, thus firmly setting course for the traditional claims of Constantinople - an expansion of Byzantine influence in the west. One can only hope that the horrors of the 17th century will not be repeated.;;;;;;;;;;;;
151019DESC;In 1788, the Imperial Army marched into the lands populated by the Serbs and the Croats, which were held by the Hungarian monarchy. In order to easier deal with the challenge of incorporating such large swathes of land (to the likes of which the Empire was not used, due to its long 'dormancy'), the special autonomous regions, or 'catepanates', were established, or, rather, revived. While such a measure has quelled the ire of the local populace, it is not a secret that it is entirely temporary. The only question is, how the catepanates will meet their end. \n\n§R If the Slavic cultures are not accepted by 1848, we will face a major revolt in this region.;;;;;;;;;;;;

151030DESC;After a long period of drafting new laws, attempting to make peace with the establishment and negotiating with the Slavs themselves, the Emperor has finally issued the Slavic Decree. The Catepanates have been dismantled, and instead Serbian and Croatian languages have been accepted as regional languages of the Empire. The Catholic faith of the Croats was to be respected, and the Serbian Orthodox Church was to be made autocephalous. All of these changes, coupled with several other smaller ones, mean one thing - the Slavs are now an integral part of the Hellenic Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;
151031DESC;Tensions in the Balkans between the various Slavic peoples and the Greeks have been mounting for a long time. As another Martletist wave hit Europe, however, unusual signs have started to appear in the Croatian and Serbian lands. Strange movements of population, an increase in interceptions of illegal armament shipments between areas, civil disobedience and other signs made it seem like an uprising was in the works - and, indeed, today, the call was sounded, and Serbia and Croatia have risen up in revolt. They demand full independence from the Empire - and with no compromise in sight, it seems like bloodshed of a scale yet unseen in the Balkans is inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;
151032DESC;The petty Slavic rebels have met a most expected end. Their ragtag militias were crushed, leaders executed and any will to fight completely eliminated. As punishment, the autonomous Catepanates were dismantled and the only language alllowed to be used in government, including educational institutions, was to be Greek. The Balkans shall never again fall out of the Empire's grasp.;;;;;;;;;;;;
151033DESC;The Slavic Rebels were much stronger than we have expected. Not only have they managed to repel the attempts by the Imperial Army to invade the heartland of the uprising, but also made incursions into the Bulgaria and other Imperial holdings. The North may have been lost for now, but Constantinople has no plans on giving the land up completely - the fight is not over yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;
151034DESC;Romans, rejoice! The ancient capital of the Empire, Caput Mundi, is once again in the hands of the only true Roman Empire. Last time the reclamation of the old capital has caused a great deal of upheaval in Western Europe, causing the Empire to lose control of the ancient city in 1653. Since then, the world has changed significantly: the Germanic pretenders to the north have lost their illegitimate titles and the Russians have been dealth with one way or another. As such, the Empire in Constantinople has outperformed all of its former rivals, and there are no more claimants left to the Roman throne. The previous occupant of the city, the so-called "Pope", has locked himself up in the Vatican, calling out for all Catholic nations to reforge the old Verona Alliance and retake Rome for himself. Whether his calls will be answered or not does not matter, for Rome is finally ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;

153009DESC;When the Constantinople Accords established the existing borders of Zapadoslavia and the Byzantine Empire, leaving the Romanian and Hungarian peoples stuck between two much stronger powers, it seemed like the fate of the two nations was sealed, as they were doomed to be subjugated by forces they could put up a fight against.\nBut as some could only resort to weeping and waiting for the inevitable death to come, the more ambitious individuals proposed a bold idea: perhaps, in spite of centuries of rivalry, the nations of Carpathia, who share the same sorrow, could put their grievances aside and unite against the inevitable threat.\nAt first, few listened to them. Then, as time went on, more and more people started questioning themselves: what other chance do the nations of Carpathia have? And so, little by little, support for the idea grew, until it finally borne fruit - here lies Carpathia, the nation that defied fate!;;;;;;;;;;;;
153010DESC;The Byzantine ambassador in $OURCAPITAL$ has handed us a strongly-worded note from Constantinople. According to these deluded fools, the young nation of Carpathia poses a threat to 'stability in the Balkans', as there are no guarantees that we will not employ hte help of Constantinople's enemies to seize the Imperial borderlands. We suspect that this letter might have been heavily influenced by the so-called 'Hellenophiles', a group of Greek intellectuals believing that the Empire should fully integrate the Balkan nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;
153011DESC;With a new period of martletist unrest raging in Europe, it becomes clear that the nations of Carpathia need to take action. The idea of a union between Hungary and Rumania is clearly not to be, so nationalist ambitions will now surely take lead.;;;;;;;;;;;;

158001DESC;A delegation from the Great Lakes Indians has recently arrived at the capital of our colonial holdings in Colombia. They, nominally our subjects, are requesting independence for their confederacy. While it may seem to be an obvious choice to send them away, it is becoming clear that old methods of dealing with the natives are becoming less and less effective. Perhaps an alliance, instead of suzerainty, would be a better arrangement?;;;;;;;;;;;;
158006DESC;The lands to our west are held by the Sioux tribes. With the Ayllonians threatening to subjugate the natives, a confederation of Sioux peoples has assembled under the leadership of chief Stinky Feet from the Sniffatoe tribe. He asked us to accept his people under our protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
158002DESC;With the complete adiption of western methods of governance our state is no longer fit to be a confederation of tribes. We will officially reform into the United Indian Nations, a federal republic on the Great Lakes!;;;;;;;;;;;;
158007DESC;When Vrijland was in its infancy, the runaway slaves from the Espanian holdings in the south played a major part in the young state's survival. Though they came in much lesser numbers than the Europeans, it is thanks to their insights and knowledge of the process of slave trade we were able to not only successfully resist the blockade imposed on us by the Celts, but also intercept many slaver ships in the Carribean. \nOver time, these runaway slaves formed a culture of their own, 'Freedmen' is what they usually call themselves. They comprise a significant minority in the southern portion of our country, and with our recent conquests in Axacan, we have freed eveen more slaves. As the process of dismantling the institution of slavery progresses, most, if not all of these men will integrate into the Freedmen culture. \n\n§BAll currenly owned Afro Latino pops will turn into Freedmen!;;;;;;;;;;;;
158008DESC;With the conquest of Ambrosia, we shall begin dismantling the institution of slavery and integrating the African diaspora in these lands into the Freedmen culture.;;;;;;;;;;;;

158014DESC;Disaster strikes. The enemy has taken over not just our great capital of Ambrosia, but all of Ayllonia proper, pushing us behind the Misisipi River. This means that we can no longer effectively call ourselves Ayllonian - as a matter of fact, our government is now dominated by the Fluvialeans. It seems to be our only choice to embrace the new identity. Long live Republica Fluvial!;;;;;;;;;;;;

158019DESC;The province of Portaiste Mor, located on the western shore of the Lake Uachtarach, is contested between the United Indian Nations, our Native ally, and the colony of Ildathach. Now that the situation in the region has changed, it is time to determine who should own this land.;;;;;;;;;;;;
158005TITLE;$FROMCOUNTRY$ protests annexation!;;;;;;;;;;;;
158003DESC;The Celtic Union has annexed the Lacustrine Confederacy, bringing large swathes of rich lands under their control. Not only is this an act of aggression of unprecedented scale, it is also an opportunity for expansion, since the broder between us and the natives was at times loosely defined. Perhaps we could demand compensation in the form of land, knowing that if the Celts refuse, the public opinion will be on our side.;;;;;;;;;;;;
158005DESC;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent us a strongly-worded message of disapproval of the annexation of the Lacustrine Confederacy. Citing their security concerns, as well as a lack of a defined border between them and the former Indian lands, they demand us to cede large swathes of land to them. While we don't expect military action to ensue if we refuse, giving in to their demands would certainly easy the tension, while not substantially lowering our prestige (that is, if we manage to word our agreement correctly - something we're undoubtedly going to be able to do). \n\n§BAyllonia's demands are the states of Wapahshiki and Muskikwam, while Vrijland's are Kanosoni.;;;;;;;;;;;
158020TITLE;$FROMCOUNTRY$ acquiesces;;;;;;;;;;;;
158020DESC;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has accepted our demands, citing their will to ease the tensions and compensate us in what was clearly a one-sided action that did not take our interests into account.;;;;;;;;;;;;

158022DESC;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused our demands without explanation. Clearly, they see our interests as aggression against their 'rightful' land. The only option now is war.;;;;;;;;;;;;
158025DESC;The radical change in the government of Vrijland has not gone unnoticed by the Black population of the country. The Freedmen, citing the authoritarian nature of the new government, have organized into groups, sometimes with their own militaries, to advocate for the independence of New Afrika, the lands with a significant Black minority, or, at times, majority. It seems like civil war is inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;
158029DESC;An Ildathach preacher by the name of Seosamh MacGabhann had long attracted substantial attention from the local authorities for his unusual theological and religious ideas. According to him, he had received a series of visions revealing a new series of scriptures regarding God's dealings with the indigenous peoples of the New World. He has founded a church of his own based on these revelations, and now, citing persectuion from the government, he and around 30,000 of his followers have began migrating west, with the goal of settling somewhere in the remote parts of the Great Plains. We expect more of these so-called 'Mormannach' to follow.;;;;;;;;;;;;
159000DESC;Ever since the beginning of the Mexican War for Independence, the sons of Colombia have been slaughtering each other, as if they were not of the same blood. But now, with the triumph of Southern arms, we may finally proclaim the United Provinces of Colombia, a nation for all Hispanocolombians!;;;;;;;;;;;;
159001DESC;Mexico was once a colony of Espania, its crown jewel and the most prized possession. As the Martletist Wars rocked Europe, however, ideas of independence started to sprawl in the New World, fueled by Vrijlander agitation and Andalusia’s failed ventures in the south. Mexico was eager to seize the opportunity and declare independence - and soon, in 1815, the Mexican War of Independence began. An ambitious general by the name of Agustin de Iturbide declared himself the Emperor of Mexico, establishing the Mexican Empire and proclaiming desire to dominate the continent - a decision that proved to be fatal, as both California and Ayllonia supported the Metropole, and soon, the Empire fell apart from within. After the War, Espania granted independence to both of its other colonies on mutually beneficial terms, and while, in the end, Mexico remained independent, it was severely cut down in size. Moreover, shortly after the end of the War, in 1821, the Province of Yucatan rebelled, demanding more autonomy for both the Yucatecs and the local natives. Now, after more than a decade of recovery, it seems like the time has come for Mexico to strike back - but first comes the fate of Yucatan.;;;;;;;;;;;;
159002DESC;Rio Grande was separated from Mexico following the disastrous attempt by the Mexican Empire to dominate the continent. They have since then grown quite hostile to the idea of being ruled by a Mexican government, for they have not forgotten the extremely centralised nature of the Empire. Now that we have reclaimed the lands along the Rio Grande, we must integrate the locals - and perhaps, instead of simple integration, we should go further and create an autonomous Republic inside of our nation, establishing precedent for integration of other nations. Who knows what roads will then be opened…;;;;;;;;;;;;
159003DESC;The colony of Tierra de Ayllon was founded in 1526 by Lucas Vazquez de Ayllon. Initially competing for investment with the neighboring Tierra de Garay, the colony turned out to be the most profitable one due to its position on the Atlantic, as well as favourable terrain. Ayllonia rapidly developed under Spanish rule, managing to maintain good relations with both the native tribes and their Metropole. \nWhen Colombia was rocked by the Mexican War of Independence in 1815, what became called Ayllonia firmly sided with the Spanish Crown, expecting reciprocation from its overlord. And in 1819 Spain did reciprocate, signing the Treaty of San Agustin, which granted independence to the Republic of Ayllonia on mutually beneficial terms. \nThough the chaos of the 1810s did lead to the loss of Ajaxan and other lands in the east to Vrijland, things are looking good for Ayllonia. In 1824, the city of Ambrosia was founded, intended to serve as a capital to the young Republic, while efforts were made in the west to integrate the lands seized from Mexico in the years prior. \nThe Republic now looks outwards - primarily towards the Mexican Gulf.;;;;;;;;;;;;
170000DESC;The League of Milan, or the Cisalpine Confederation, is often described as "the worst way to organize a state". It was created as a result of the Italian Wars of Unification - a series of conquests by an ambitious duke Napoleone di Buonaparte, who seized the throne of Savoy in 1803. His short-lived Kingdom of Italy contributed much to the general instability of Europe during the Martletist Wars, eventually being destroyed by the combined forces of France, Arles and Bavaria. \nOn the ashes of the liberal Kingdom, a new state was born. Or, to say, a union of states: the reinstated Italian states were forced to join a "league", with its political organisation being based on the Nordseebund. Despite the success of the aforementioned North German state, the project turned out to be a disaster for Italy and a great boon for the Great Powers of Europe. Plagued by instability and power struggles, the dukes of Cisalpinia have continuously chosen to make woe with each other, instead of focusing on more pressing matters. \nAs a new crisis looms, it is not a question of if the League will collapse. Instead, it's a question of when. The long-awaited Italian unification may finally be in sight.;;;;;;;;;;;;
170001DESC;The League of Milan is pressuring us to continue the talks that were started in 1831 about our accession to the League. The last major round of talks ended in July 1835 in bad mood, and it seems like Milan is trying to make us sign a dal without thinking. What they don't know however, is that Tuscany has contacted us recently and is willing to accept us into vassalage (in case Milan acts up) under better terms. We will inform them that all we can offer is heavy autonomy and, most importantly, keeping the title of 'Duchy' - something other Dukes will not like.;;;;;;;;;;;;
170002DESC;We have received a response from Lucca! \nAnd they are way worse than we were expecting. They say that the length of the talks 'clearly signifies the impossibility of the Duchy to join the League', and have made one last offer: heavy autonomy and, most importantly, keeping the title of 'Duchy' - something that the other Dukes will not like. The opposition has already made sure to make fun of the government, but we've got one last trick up our sleeve - force of arms. While we are not actually planning to invade Lucca, we will mobilise the army on the border to scare them.;;;;;;;;;;;;
170003DESC;Without saying a single word, the League has mobilised its army on our border. Clearly, they are trying to scare us into signing whatever fits them. We, however, have an ally they don't know about - Tuscany! We should contact them before the League accidentally starts shooting again, like it was during the 1827 Ostiglia incident.;;;;;;;;;;;;
170004DESC;We have received rushed reports from Lucca that the army of the League of Milan has mobilised on the border with the small Duchy. As per our previous promises, we will publicly announce that we will defend Lucca against Northern aggression.;;;;;;;;;;;;
170005DESC;The worst possible scenario has come to reality. The Duke of Tuscany has publicly announced that he will defend Lucca against any 'Northern aggression', exposing our plans and immediately ending any possibility of Luccan accession to the League. The Tuscan Army has begun moving into Lucca, and it seems like the two countries are closer than ever. \nNow Lucca is the least of our worries however, because the complete failure of the government has triggered an indescribable reaction from the public. It's not just the opposition that's shouting at us, it's the entire country. And considering how things usually are in the League, things are bound to get worse. Way worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;
170006DESC;With the final preparations being complete, we are proud to announce that the Duchy of Lucca will unite with the Duchy of Tuscany, thus creating the Kingdom of Tuscany. This is a glorious day for all Tuscans!;;;;;;;;;;;;
170007DESC;While the situation on the homefront worsens, another horrible development has just occurred to our south. The Duchy of Lucca has decided to... unite with the Grand Duchy of Tuscany to create the Kingdom of Tuscany. We can only watch in shock as Firenze managed to easily acomplish in days what we couldn't acomplish in years. The public, as you can guess, is... 'delighted' at hearing these news.;;;;;;;;;;;;
170008DESC;As days went by, the public outrage at the government's actions only grew. The people remembered all of the past failures, those going back to the 1820s and even before the Martletist Wars, as the constituent Duchies' governments were being targeted as well. Calling the elections now seems like a choice, but considering the state in which Milan is right now, it is only going to worsen the violence. Only a deus ex machina is going to save the League now.;;;;;;;;;;;;
170009DESC;As the situation hits a breaking point, a curious individual has shown up in Turin. That individual goes by the name Napoleone di Buonaparte, and he is the son of the dead King Napoleone, the family of whom had been living in exile on the island of Corsica. 'L'Aquilotto' ('the Eaglet'), as he had been called, has slipped through the chaos and landed at the port of Genoa about a week ago. After arriving in Turin, his father's old domain and a monarchist stronghold, he made his presence public, immediately assembling a significant number of his followers who became his own little army. Lacking a cause to support, the people have quickly rallied to the opportunist's cause, proclaiming him as 'Napoleone II'. \nNow he and his army find themselves at the gates of Milan. Hearing an upcoming monarchist restoration, the most radical elements of the city have assembled the 'Popular Guard' in an attempt to stop Napoleone and bring an end to the chaos themselves. And after a brief but bloody battle...;;;;;;;;;;;;
170010DESC;After the government of the League of Milan disastrously failed to finish the negotiations concerning Lucca's accession to the League, the city of Milan fell into chaos. Amidst the general instability of the countryside, a curious individual by the name of Napoleone di Buonaparte, the son of the previous reigning King of Italy, whose family had been living in exile in Corisca, slipped into the country and assembled an army of his followers with the goal of retaking his father's throne. Following a bloody battle for the city, in which Napoleone's forces triumphed, he was crowned with the Iron Crown and decalred the King of Cisalpinia, after which he embarked on a glorious campaign of pacification across the countryside in order to bring the Dukes in line. In a few short days, he and his army burned down much of Northern Italy, but in the end succeeded in bringing in line the former constituents of the League. One of them, the city of Genoa, proved to be particularly resistant, which led to most of it being destroyed in the siege.;;;;;;;;;;;;
170011DESC;After the government of the League of Milan disastrously failed to finish the negotiations concerning Lucca's accession to the League, the city of Milan fell into chaos. As the violence in Milan got worse, an individual by the name of Napoleone di Buonaparte, the son of the previous reigning King of Italy, showed up at the gates of the city with an army with the goal of retaking his father's throne. He was met with stiff resistance by La Guardia Popolare, 'The Popular Guard' assembled by the most radical elements of the city. Following his defeat and escape into Switzerland, the new Provisionary Government has declared the dissolution of the League, sending the Popular Guard on a campaign to pacify the countryside. Now, the Cisalpine Republic has been established as a strong force in the Italian Peninsula.;;;;;;;;;;;;
170012DESC;The Pope's act of a general amnesty for political prisoners did not consider its potential implications and consequences. The freed revolutionaries merely resumed their previous activities, and his concessions only provoked greater demands. Following the assassination of his prime minister in $YEAR$, Pope Pius IX fled Rome and took refuge in the south. Giuseppe Mazzini and colleagues proclaimed the end of papal power and prepared a modern constitution for the newly announced Roman Republic. From his fortress at Gaeta, Pius IX called on the Catholic powers of Europe to send their armies to restore him to power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
170013DESC;Should we unite with our northern brothers? We've got the same government type, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;
170014DESC;The newly-established Roman Republic has petitioned us to join the Cisalpine Republic. There seems to be no donsides to doing this. Shall we accept?;;;;;;;;;;;;
171000DESC;The Kingdom of Arles resides in a precarious position. The echoes of the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire are still felt in Lower Burgundy, with both the population and the government being unsure as to what Arles' future shall be. Thriving under the protection of Brussels for centuries, Arles slowly lost any ideas of European domination, instead turning into a small trade empire. As such, with the long-time protector gone, the Arelat people have found themselves confused, without a national idea of any sorts. The collapse of the sisterly Occitania during the Martletist Wars forced the nation to take up arms and reluctantly participate in the bloodbath around it, heavily contributing to the defeat of the rebel forces on all fronts. With these threats gone however, Arles finds itself in a new world, where inaction will be severely punished. The Kingdom must finally put its potential to use - though where it will bring Arles is a mystery only time is able to solve.;;;;;;;;;;;;
171001DESC;Recent events have shown us that the situation on the Balearic Isles cannot continue as it is. As such, the Balearic Isles Commission, established after the Martletist Wars, will be disestablished, and the isles will be annexed directly into our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;
172000DESC;The idea of France is not a new one - and yet, just 20 years ago, there was no such thing on the map of Europe. \nA long time ago, the united nation of West Frankia was shattered into feuding duchies by invaders from the south, and while out of their southern portion arose the Kingdom of Occitania, the north failed to unify. Only the Danish intervention to support the Norman dukes in the 13th century lead to the creation of Oilitania, a long-time underdog and a close ally of the Danes. \nThings radically changed with the onset of the Martletist Wars, as the powerful Occitania fell to rebel forces. Oilitania then saw an excellent opportunity, and indeed, following a long and grueling war, the two kingdoms were finally united into one - France. Now standing as one of the most powerful nations of Europe, France seeks to bring an era of unprecedented French power and prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;
158026DESC;The Acadian Rush was a period of heavy immigration to the colony of Acadia following the persecution of the Martletist Wave of 1835-36, when many of those who were unhappy with the establishment in Europe decided to move to Colombia. The colony of Acadia itself is heavily autonomous, and Paris has been using it as a penal colony for the longest time, so prevalence of liberal thought in it is not unheard of. For now though, Acadia will experience an era of growth and economic prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;
158027DESC;With the period of increased immigration to Acadia having subsided, the French government will now have to deal with the consequnces of the colony's continuing development of a national identity. Calls for independence of Acadia are now heard more and more - maybe, it is time for the youngling to finally leave the mother's nest.;;;;;;;;;;;;
158028DESC;As the years go by, the calls for independence of Acadia are growing louder and louder. Perhaps it would be better to follow the example of our southern neighbors, the Espanians, and sign an agreement with our colonial subjects on mutually beneficial terms, lest it turns into another Vrijland.;;;;;;;;;;;;

Ever since the first time the two groups met in the early 17th century, they have competed over the southern part of the Andes, trying to sway the various natives of the area and exploit the valuable resources. And despite the tensions never culminating in an all-out war, the problem of animosity still persists, being most evident in the loosely-delineated border between the two nations. With such issues becoming rarer and rarer, perhaps we should also consider signing a border agreement and properly delineating our southern border.;;;;;;;;;;;;

154000DESC;Zapadoslavia is not a state born of its own volition - in fact, it struggled as hard as it could to not be born. The Polish and the Czech parts have been separate polities just a few decades back, though ruled by one King in a personal union. Thus it has been for almost four centuries, but all of this time was spent not for the state’s own betterment, but in a delusion of the nobility that if the Duchy of Lithuania fell, Poland would follow. Endless wars in the east ensued: every time, just as it was thought peace was reached, Bohemia and Poland were once again dragged into a doomed military endeavour by their Lithuanian allies. \nThis state of affairs came to an end with the beginning of the Martletist Wars. The patience of the commoners (and the thinkers alike) ran dry, and Poland was seized by those willing to see a united West Slavic state, - Bohemia was to follow, but with a condition that the King remained in power. And as the Wars came to an end, this state of affairs remained - a King in charge of a nation he didn’t wish for. But this is what everyone will have to contend with.;;;;;;;;;;;;
154001DESC;Poland's relation with the Baltic Sea is a troubled one. Managing to reclaim Pomerelia for a short time in the 15th century, the Polish Coast was given up once again to the Germans less than a century later. Though small territorial concessions were made here and there, the Martletist Wars solidified the independent Duchy of Prussia, previously existing with an uncertain status as a subject of Bohemia. Now that Poland is an equal to Bohemia, Prussia was integrated directly into it - and, with the destruction of this fleeting German statelet, Poland is forevermore bound to the sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;
166025DESC;Aimar Chambon was the governor of the Occitan colony of Meridionalia when the Metropole fell to the Revolution. Holding reactionary views, he refused to betray his Motherland and declare independence of the colony, instead starting preparations for an expedition to Europe to reclaim what was lost. He even managed to convince the government of Antartida to postpone the planned declaration of independence and aid Chambon in reclaiming Occitania. \nAs time went on, the reclamation was nowhere to be seen. Eventually, the Constantinople Accords decided that the kingdoms of Oilitania and Occitania shall be united into one entity, France, and that the colonial empire of the latter shall go its own way. In the following years, Antartida finally abandoned the doomed ambition, while resistance against Chambon on the homefront continued to grow ever stronger. And now, those calling for an independent future for Meridionalia have finally won, as Aimar Chambor died at the age of 80. A republic was swiftly declared, its destiny no longer tied to that of Occitania.;;;;;;;;;;;;

162000DESC;Antartida was an Occitan colony established in the 16th century. Being Occitania's largest colonial holding, it received the lion's share of attention, as all other colonies paled in comparison to Antartida. Experiencing rapid growth due to increasing immigration in the 18th century, Antartida developed a strong yet loyal national identity, with an imperious attitude towards the entire South Atlantic. Slavery 'prospered' as well, especially in the North, where small-scale slave trade occured with Numanbolan slaveholders, despite the ban on trading slaves to foreigners imposed by the Malian government. \nRevolution in the Metropole shook Antartida to its core. Despite the nation clearly being ready to part its ways with Occitania, many refused to abandon the Motherland and declare formal independence. This sentiment had further been boosted by Aimar Chambon, the governor of Meridionalia, who vowed to reclaim the lost homeland by all means necessary. Hesitation peristed all the way into the 1820, when, following the annexation of Occitania, the Republic was finally decalred - ready to dominate its region, as it had already done with the recently conquered Sadancan.;;;;;;;;;;;;
162002DESC;Camp del Cel is an area in the Secaia where a large quantity of iron meteorites have been known to be located since the 16th century. The crater field covers 18.5 by 3 kilometres and contains at least 26 craters, the largest being 115 by 91 metres. Before the arrival of the Occitans, the deposits were used by the natives to make rudimentary tools, but not much has been done about the existence of the meteorite ever since.\nWith our recent prospecting efforts in the western part of Antartida, a renewed interest arose about Camp del Cel. While the quantities of iron are small, several tens of tonnes is nothing to scoff at, and small-scale extraction effort has already been set up. The question is: shall we put the iron to industrial use or, considering the rarity of meteoritic iron and the not-so-exciting quantities of it in the deposit, take the pieces to museums and scientists?;;;;;;;;;;;;
169005DESC;The Byzantine Empire starts with an active minigame which decides your future expansion options. The Roman path (the Metaxas one) will give you cores on Italy and add N. and S. Italian as accepted cultures. You will also have to fase the Slavic revolt (starts in 1848, involves Serbia and Croatia). The Greek parth offers you the possibility to avoid the revolt (if you follow the decisions), switches your name to the Hellenic Empire, gives you cores on Romania and Hungary and adds Romanian, Hungarian, Serbian, Croatian, Slovene and Bulgarian as accepted cultures.\nIf the Hellenophile influence reaches 10, you will be set for the Greek path. If it reaches 0, or the year is 1841 (in this case the MTTH is 2 years), Metaxas will win and you will be set for the Roman path.\nThe outcome of the Crimean War will NOT lock you into any path, it will just help you nudge the value into the right direction.;;;;;;;;;;;;
